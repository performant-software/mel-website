MEL’s Projects section is where visitors come to draw upon our Archive and Editions to create new scholarship in the form of essays, presentations, exhibits, or classroom assignments.

In the workspaces we currently have and in those we hope to develop, we provide opportunities for scholars, editors, instructors, students, and general readers to assemble and sort materials, and generate projects that will be added to the MEL platform.

Already available are tools like TextLab and Juxta Editions, with which MEL editors create our MEL editions. With access accounts, visitors to MEL can also use these tools to make editions of their own. Visitors also have access to Hofstra DRC’s Itinerary to annotate historical maps over time, with links to Melville-related materials in MEL’s Archive and Editions sections. In time, we will develop a workspace where users can enter MIT-HyperStudio’s Annotation Studio, select a MEL text, and annotate it. So far, we are sponsoring Projects on Melville’s touring of London and Rome, his Geographical Imagination in Moby-Dick, student revision narratives regarding selected revision sites in the Billy Budd manuscript, Melville’s family circle, Melville’s art print collection, and the Bradbury-Huston film adaptation of Moby-Dick.

With future funding, we plan to develop Melville ReMix, a workspace that will allow users to search, sort, and assemble images and texts from MEL’s archive and editions for scholarly publication, pedagogical assignments, and general circulation. If you were to imagine a tool like Melville ReMix, what would it enable you do with MEL’s Archive and Editions? Consult our Use Cases for ideas, and send us ideas of your own.

If you have a Use Case to add or a MEL project of your own to discuss, please  [Contact US](mailto:John.L.Bryant@hofstra.edu).
