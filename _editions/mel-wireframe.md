The wireframe demonstrates the integration of editorial work in TextLab’s Primary and Secondary Editing with Juxta Editions’s Tertiary Editing (textual and contextual annotation).

TextLab sends TEI-xml transcriptions to MELCat, which also contains metadata on Artwork, Persons, Places, Events, and Texts. Juxta Editions uploads TextLab editing through MELCat for further annotation, using Annotation Studio technology and links to MELCat metadata. Finished editions are exported to GitHub and released through MEL.
