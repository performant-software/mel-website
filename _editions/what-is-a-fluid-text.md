#### Editing Fluid Texts 

Apart from offering reliable digital editions of Melville's writings,
MEL's signal editorial contribution is that digitization also enables us
to read Melville's works as fluid texts. A fluid text is any written
work that exists in multiple versions due to authorial, editorial, or
adaptive revision. These kinds of versions are critically significant in
studying Melville's revision process and the way editors and other
readers have also changed his texts. All written works are fundamentally
fluid texts; the problem is gaining access to the versions that reveal
the revisions and editing the revisions so that readers can read them.
That problem is best addressed through digital editing.

In two books—*The Fluid Text: A Theory of Revision and Editing for
Book and Screen* (2002) and *Melville Unfolding* (2008)—and in various
editions, chapters, and essays, John Bryant theorized on fluid-text
analysis and offered protocols for editing fluid texts. (See
Bibliography.) In them, he argues that our scope of literary
interpretation has been limited to a reductive and static notion of the
texts that constitute a written work. We typically imagine a written
"work" to be a single, original, textual object. A broader perspective
conceives of "work" as the energy a culture (represented by writers,
editors, adaptors) puts into delivering "versions" associated with an
originating title into the public sphere, over time. The study of fluid
texts aims to make sense of this flow of cultural energies evident in
revisions and versions.

Naturally enough, scholars, critics, and general readers alike desire a
single, reliable text of, let's say *Typee*, *Moby-Dick*, or *Billy
Budd*, if only to have a common textual playing field for interpreting
those works. The assumption has been that the author "intended" one
version when in reality a literary work invariably evolves through
multiple and meaningful versions, regardless of a single unifying, "final" intention. For whatever reasons, writers re-write, editors modify or expurgate, and adaptors reshape a text to fit their own interpretations. Not surprisingly,
though, editors and publishers generally shape their efforts to reduce
the complex evolutionary history of a fluid text in their publication of
single, presumably "definitive" editions. MEL's aim, however, is to
offer an editorial alternative that enables readers to experience
Melville's evolving texts. To gain this broader fluid-text perspective,
we need new ways of editing to supplement single-text editing practice,
and digital technology facilitates the fluid-text editorial process.

Traditionally, scholarly editing focuses on creating a single reading
text that represents the editor's conception of a single moment of the
author's "final intentions" during the production of a written work.
This moment of intentionality can vary; it might be the period of time
during which a writer submits a fair copy manuscript to a publisher for
further copy-editing or when the writer returns corrected page proofs,
or (much later) supervises a subsequent revised edition. Through the
critical editions they produce, scholarly editors play a fundamental
role in supplying information about the single moment of
intentionality they choose to represent in their reading text. The
reliability of their editions resides in the editors' forthright
announcement of their conception of intentionality and justification for
their reading text. These explanations include their display of the
textual fluidities surrounding the work and discussions of their
decisions to choose one variant (textual fluidity) over the others.

But given the limitations of print technology, these vital arguments are
invariably placed in a Note on the Text and a Textual Apparatus,
including endnotes or tables, consigned to appendices of scholarly
editions, and the editions themselves are generally designed for library
use only. In time, as publishers reprint the reading text of a scholarly
edition for circulation beyond institutional libraries to the general
public and schools, they omit the textual note, endnotes, and apparatus,
so that the explanation of the original edition's editorial process and the information concerning revision and versions effectively disappears. With that
disappearance, readers are also deprived of valuable information related
to the history of the work as a fluid text.

MEL's fluid-text editions are designed not only to give fuller and more
immediate access to this invaluable information and to verify and
augment that textual record but also to reconfigure the data so that
readers can navigate Melville's revisions and the versions of his works
as they read MEL's reading texts.

The idea of the fluid text is nothing new to textual scholars. Modern
scholarly editors have always addressed the challenges of fluid texts;
witness the editing of the Bible, Shakespeare, Whitman, or Joyce. But
conventional scholarly editing tends to view textual variation as a sign
of errors to be corrected rather than evidence of revision. The "clean"
reading text that traditional scholarly editions typically promote marginalizes
variants, mixes versions, and masks revision. The Northwestern-Newberry
(NN) edition of *The Writings of Herman Melville* (1968-2017) is a case
in point. The edition's goal is to provide a reading text that
represents the editors' conception of Melville's final intentions before
he submitted his work to editors and publishers. This "private" text is
achieved by selecting one version of the work as copy text and then
emending it, based on variants from other versions. By design, the NN's
mixed-version or "eclectic" editions offer an idealized Melville
unconstrained by editors and audiences.

The concern from a fluid-text perspective is that editions that mix
versions also mask the reality of the authorial and non-authorial
revision processes that produce the versions that give us insight into
the processes of creativity, publication, and adaptation. But rather
than supplant the NN edition—whose scholarship has been instrumental
in identifying the versions of Melville's works—MEL's digital,
fluid-text editions showcase Melville's revisions, through sequential versions. We use standard protocols of transcription, collation, diplomatic display,
copy-text, emendation, and annotation to edit each version of a Melville
work from scratch. We also settle on a minimally-modified "base version" of the work we are editing, which we use as a platform for linking to revisions in the work's other versions. This kind of digital navigation enables readers to examine a range of intentionalities: Melville's shifting intentions in manuscript,
his final intentions or "private" version of a work released to
publishers as well as the intentions of editors in shaping his texts,
and adaptive versions that continue to reshape his texts in public.

A work like *Billy Budd*, which Melville never saw through the press, is
particularly demonstrative. This fluid text exists as a complete but
unpolished manuscript that contains thousands of revisions, each
representing the writer's evolving or oscillating intentions. A work
like *Typee* which exists in manuscript, two first editions, and two
revised editions, shows that Melville's intentions shifted not only at
the time of composition but also over a period of forty years. A work
like *Moby-Dick*, which exists in two first editions also demonstrates
that editorial forces—evident in the expurgations of Britain's *The
Whale*—represent external forces that inflect, even censor, the
writer's words. And when a writer like Melville or his individual
works—like *Typee*, *Moby-Dick*, *Billy Budd*, and others—gain
international recognition and capture the popular imagination of
generations extending beyond Melville's lifetime, we find additional
versions of these works in adaptation and translation, which represent a
culture's need to revise the very texts they idolize. To authorial and
editorial revision, then, the scope of MEL's fluid-text editions extends
to adaptive revisions in stage, film, opera, fine arts, music, and even
the "meme."

If we want to study not only the private and but also the social
processes that impel a writer like Melville, his editors, or his
international adaptors to revise Melville's fluid text, we need fuller
access to a fuller scope of versions of a work (in manuscript, print,
and adaptation) and a fuller embracing of revision as an authorial,
editorial, and adaptive process. The access and embrace cannot happen
without archiving the versions and editing them. Digital editing offers
approaches to editing that facilitate our understanding of fluid texts.

Digitization allows us to archive the versions, but subjecting readers
to a "data dump" of manuscript and page images is useless without
providing users the means of navigating the texts of these versions and
ways to highlight their textual fluidities. One fundamental problem is
that revision is an invisible phenomenon, and a revision only becomes
visible when we edit it into visibility. For example, in his 1845
working-draft of *Typee*, Melville typically revised the inflammatory
word "savage" to the culturally neutral "native" or "islander." He and
perhaps his brother Gansevoort made further, similar cultural and
stylistic revisions as *Typee* was going into press in England in 1846,
and, later that year, Melville expurgated the book for American readers.
This range of revision in *Typee* represents the private and social
forces that shaped Melville's politics and creativity. But to "read"
Melville's ***savage* ---\> *native*** revisions, not to mention all of
the rest of them, requires us to transcribe the manuscript, collate it
with the print versions, identify revision sites, determine revision
sequences, and compose explanatory revision narratives.

MEL designed its editing tool TextLab to facilitate the transcribing and coding necessary to address these editorial challenges. As a partner project in the University of Chicago's [CEDAR digital initiative](https://voices.uchicago.edu/cedar/), MEL also uses the [OCHRE database platform](https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/ochre-data-service) to curate texts and images. In turn, we use Performant Software's critical editing platform FairCopy (formerly Juxta Editions) to develop interfaces that access MEL data in the OCHRE database and enable the navigating of the versions. TextLab automates the labor-intensive TEI coding of revision sites, thus making the important and intellectually stimulating process of manuscript transcription available to scholars, critics, and students. TextLab also automatically generates a diplomatic transcription and base version of a given manuscript leaf, and it enables the creation of revision sequences and narratives. In FairCopy, editors can emend TextLab transcriptions,
create textual and contextual notes, collate versions, and create
further revision annotations. Both tools along with MELCat, our archival
content manager, work together in an integrated platform to give readers access to the versions of a fluid text in a reliable format. Because MEL's textual
core exists in the highly atomized OCHRE database, MEL editions exist on
a platform that assures continued sustainability and enhanced potential
for interoperability with other Melville projects or digital sties of all kinds. For further technical details, visit our [MEL Toolkit].

Different Melville works pose different challenges in coding and
navigation. MEL's first step, then, was to create three "model"
editions—*Moby-Dick*, *Battle-Pieces*, and *Billy Budd*—to address
these challenges, which are discussed in more detail in Versions of
Melville.
