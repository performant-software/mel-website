![image-title-here](/images/editions_first_english_american_editions.jpg){:class="col-xs-2 img-responsive"} When fully realized, MEL’s “textual core” will consist of an integrated set of scholarly digital editions of Melville’s works.  Each edition is created by MEL editors, from scratch, and provides reliable reading texts for general circulation. Readers can access each edition separately through the links to the right. In MEL’s Projects section, readers can draw down passages from the editions to generate scholarly and pedagogical projects.

Because Melville’s works are “fluid texts”—they exist in multiple versions due to authorial, editorial, and adaptive revision—our digital editions also enable you to navigate the versions of Melville’s work, so that you may get a closer look at his creative process and at the cultural conditions that motivated him, his editors, or adaptors to make changes to his texts.  To learn more about fluid texts, go to [What is a Fluid Text](/what-is-a-fluid-text.html).
