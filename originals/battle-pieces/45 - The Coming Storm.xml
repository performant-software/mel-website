A Picture by S. R. Gifford, and owned by E. B.
Included in the N. A. Exhibition, April, 1865

</p><p>All feeling hearts must feel for him
  Who felt this picture. Presage dim—
Dim inklings from the shadowy sphere
  Fixed him and fascinated here.

</p><p>A demon-cloud like the mountain one
  Burst on a spirit as mild
As this urned lake, the home of shades.
  But Shakspeare&amp;apos;s pensive child

</p><p>Never the lines had lightly scanned,
  Steeped in fable, steeped in fate;
The Hamlet in his heart was &amp;apos;ware,
  Such hearts can antedate.

</p><p>No utter surprise can come to him
  Who reaches Shakspeare&amp;apos;s core;
That which we seek and shun is there—
    Man&amp;apos;s final lore.</p></body>
