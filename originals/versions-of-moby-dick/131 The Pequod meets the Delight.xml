THE PEQUOD MEETS THE DELIGHT

</p><p>THE intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably misnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.
Upon the stranger’s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and some few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled, half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.

</p><p>“Hast seen the White Whale?”

</p><p>“Look!” replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.

</p><p>“Hast killed him?”

</p><p>“The harpoon is not yet forged that will ever do that,” answered the other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.

</p><p>“Not forged!” and snatching <ref target="#ref_18740">Perth’s levelled iron</ref><note xml:id="ref_18740">Perth’s levelled iron: Ahab’s harpoon; see Ch. 113.</note> from the crotch, Ahab held it out, exclaiming—“Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this hand I hold his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin, where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!”

</p><p>“Then God keep thee, old man—see’st thou that”—pointing to the hammock—“I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only yesterday; but were dead ere night. Only that one I bury; the rest were buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb.” Then turning to his crew—“Are ye ready there? place the plank then on the rail, and lift the body; so, then—Oh! God”—advancing towards the hammock with uplifted hands—“<ref target="#ref_18741">may the resurrection and the life</ref><note xml:id="ref_18741">“may the resurrection and the life——”: Approximate wording of the burial service in the Episcopal Book of Common Prayer, alluding to John 11.25, “Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life.”</note>——”

</p><p>“Brace forward! Up helm!” cried Ahab like lightning to his men.

</p><p>But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not so quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism.

</p><p>As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy hanging at the Pequod’s stern came into conspicuous relief.

</p><p>“Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!” cried a foreboding voice in her wake. “In vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us your taffrail to show us your coffin!”</p></body>
