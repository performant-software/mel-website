</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">IN bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo’s judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Now, this plan of Queequeg’s, or rather Yojo’s, touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg’s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517803659426-7n3lyp0ynzd-2fc030ac7e57a7160d94fb962bc6ca04%2FMD_Amer_0113.jpg"/> quickly settle that trifling little affair.

Although "Pequot" means “destroyer,” the nation was nearly annihilated in the <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:1049" type="artwork">Pequot War</name> of 1636-1638.

I peered and pryed about the Devil-Dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and, finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;—<ref target="#ref_21371">square-toed luggers</ref><note xml:id="ref_21371">square-toed luggers, ... junks . . . galliots: types of old-fashioned sailing vessels.</note>; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything; with an old fashioned claw-footed look about her.

All noble things are touched with that.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast.

A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the ship’s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the <ref target="#ref_16969">Quaker style</ref><note xml:id="ref_16969">Quaker style: Plain and square-cut. Blue was a common color for seamen, though Quakers usually wore brown.</note>; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of the tent.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Supposing it be the Captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?” he demanded.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“I was thinking of shipping.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:30" type="place">Nantucket</name>er—ever been in a stove boat?”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I protested my innocence of these things.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“I do, sir.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale’s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But concentrating all his crow’s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the errand.
<pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517803854011-kmby6oapwqp-2fc030ac7e57a7160d94fb962bc6ca04%2FMD_Amer_0118.jpg"/>
</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Well, what’s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye see?”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though, and there’s a <ref target="#ref_16999">squall</ref><note xml:id="ref_16999">squall: sudden storm.</note> coming up, I think.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Well, what dost thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go round <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:60" type="place">Cape Horn</name> to see any more of it, eh? Can’t ye see the world where you stand?”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to ship me.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.

It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old <ref target="#ref_21379">annuitants</ref><note xml:id="ref_21379">annuitants . . . chancery wards: people living on fixed annual income; chancery wards are under court guardianship.</note>; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517803934451-tls1nypx1kb-2fc030ac7e57a7160d94fb962bc6ca04%2FMD_Amer_0119.jpg"/> and heterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the most <ref target="#ref_17002">sanguinary</ref><note xml:id="ref_17002">sanguinary: bloodthirsty.</note> of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting Quakers; they are <ref target="#ref_16966">Quakers with a vengeance</ref><note xml:id="ref_16966">Quakers with a vengeance: A play on words: members of the Religious Society of Friends, known as Quakers because they were said to tremble in awe of God’s word, are pacifists by creed, and thus should not be given to fighting or revenge.</note>.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:136" type="place">Scandinavia</name>n sea-king, or a poetical Pagan <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:8" type="place">Rom</name>an. And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature’s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin, voluntary, and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes one in a whole nation’s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful over-ruling <ref target="#ref_17003">morbidness</ref><note xml:id="ref_17003">morbidness: unhealthy preoccupation with unwholesome matters.</note> at the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.

Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:33" type="place">Atlantic</name> and <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:35" type="place">Pacific</name>; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon <ref target="#ref_17006">tuns</ref><note xml:id="ref_17006">tuns: huge barrels holding 252 gallons.</note> of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man’s religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This world pays dividends.

For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least.

When <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517804040587-4bm8nwlyac6-2fc030ac7e57a7160d94fb962bc6ca04%2FMD_Amer_0121.jpg"/> Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-colored eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something—a hammer or a <ref target="#ref_17009">marling-spike</ref><note xml:id="ref_17009">marling-spike: pointed steel tool used in splicing rope.</note>, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished from before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His <ref target="#ref_17010">broad-brim</ref><note xml:id="ref_17010">broad-brim: hat generally worn by Quaker men.</note> was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been studying those <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/text:157" type="text">Scriptures</name>, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“He says he’s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“I <hi rend="italic">dost</hi>,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply. <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517804097157-3bqrtj44833-2fc030ac7e57a7160d94fb962bc6ca04%2FMD_Amer_0122.jpg"/> Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship’s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called <hi rend="italic">lays</hi>, and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship’s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship, <ref target="#ref_17012">splice a rope</ref><note xml:id="ref_17012">splice a rope: weaving together the ends of two ropes.</note>, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the <ref target="#ref_16964">275th lay</ref><note xml:id="ref_16964">275th lay: Ishmael’s share would be 0.36 percent of the voyage’s profit.</note>—that is, the 275th part of the clear nett proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather <hi rend="italic">long lay</hi>, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years’ beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one <ref target="#ref_17013">stiver</ref><note xml:id="ref_17013">stiver: small Dutch coin.</note>.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsi-<pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517804142692-qle1x3rr09s-2fc030ac7e57a7160d94fb962bc6ca04%2FMD_Amer_0123.jpg"/>derable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship’s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “<ref target="#ref_21382"><hi rend="italic">Lay</hi> not up</ref><note xml:id="ref_21382">“‘Lay not up . . . where moth—’”: “Stingy” Bildad’s selective muttering of scripture reveals him to be perhaps stingy, perhaps conscientious, perhaps self-serving, and Melville’s comic treatment of the stern figure brings out his apparent hypocrisies. The full passage from which he draws is “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also” (Matthew 6:19–21). In quoting Jesus, Bildad deletes the biblical passage’s reference to “thieves,” perhaps avoiding allusion to his own thievery in offering Ishmael the absurd 777th lay; his subsequent focus on widows, orphans, and Peleg’s “conscience” might also be self-serving.</note> for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d’ye say, what lay shall we give this young man?”

It was an exceedingly <hi rend="italic">long lay</hi> that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a <hi rend="italic">teenth</hi> of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a <ref target="#ref_17015">farthing</ref><note xml:id="ref_17015">farthing: British coin worth one-fourth of a penny. </note> is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold <ref target="#ref_17016">doubloons</ref><note xml:id="ref_17016">doubloons: Spanish gold coins weighing one ounce and worth 16 silver dollars.</note>; and so I thought at the time.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, “Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans, many of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can’t tell; but as thou art still an <ref target="#ref_16961">impenitent man</ref><note xml:id="ref_16961">drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms . . . impenitent man: “Drawing” refers to how much water a vessel needs to float; here, 10 inches implies innocence, while 60 feet implies a guilty conscience. Impenitent means unrepentant, and more generally, resistant to God’s will. Revivalist preachers of the day urged listeners to renounce their “impenitent state” and seek salvation. Although Quakerism, like other Protestant denominations, had its own range of adherents, some of them fundamentalist, they did not require public announcements of faith. Documents on faith and practice in the New York and the New England Yearly Meetings of the Society of Friends (Quakers) do not mention “impenitence” as a barrier to membership in a meeting, although members might be “disowned” if their unspiritual behavior persisted. By calling Peleg an “impenitent man,” Bildad is asserting his opinion that as a Quaker, Peleg is excessively secular and profane.</note>, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”
