NIGHTGOWN

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WE had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517781952699-m2k6jsl5f3-55d53717902bf6a1c7e48f20e923fdc7%2FMD_Amer_0096.jpg"/> <ref target="#ref_27160"><hi rend="bold">and Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free and easy were we;</hi></ref><note xml:id="ref_27160">Revision Narrative:
Ishmael and Queequeg: Bosom Friends // In a set of expurgations regarding sexual content, Melville's British editor expurgated the image of Queequeg throwing his legs over Ishmael's and Queequeg and Ishmael's "free and easy" sociability.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the head-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two noses bending over them, as if our knee-pans were <ref target="#ref_16048">warming-pans</ref><note xml:id="ref_16048">warming-pans: long-handled, covered pans holding hot coals, for warming beds.</note>. We felt very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the room. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. But if, like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm. For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:974" type="artwork">arctic crystal</name>.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517781967130-wneyj8uf4y-55d53717902bf6a1c7e48f20e923fdc7%2FMD_Amer_0097.jpg"/>closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey part. Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve-o’clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable revulsion. Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk. Be it said, that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them. For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then. I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord’s policy of insurance. I was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend. With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging <ref target="#ref_16049">tester</ref><note xml:id="ref_16049">tester: bed canopy.</note> of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island; and, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He gladly complied. Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.</p></div></body>
