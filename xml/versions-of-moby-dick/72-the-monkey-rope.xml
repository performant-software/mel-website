</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">IN THE tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the <ref target="#ref_22027">description of the scene</ref><note xml:id="ref_22027">description of the scene: Mansfield and Vincent in their edition of <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi> (764) trace the following description to Francis Allyn Olmsted's <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/text:203"><hi rend="italic">Incidents of a Whaling Voyage</hi></ref>.</note>. We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale’s back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster’s back for the special purpose referred to. But in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the <ref target="#ref_20765">Highland costume—a shirt and socks—</ref><note xml:id="ref_20765">Highland costume—a <hi rend="bold">shirt</hi> and socks—: To Ishmael, Queequeg's wearing of only a shirt and socks suggests the wearing of kilts by Scottish Highlanders and therefore the exposure on occasion of errogenous zones, to "uncommon advantage." However, cf. Ch. 4, "The Counterpane," in which Ishmael describes "the indecorous figure that Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on." The NN editors emend the American and British wording of “shirt” to “skirt,” assuming that Melville intended Queequeg to be wearing a kilt. MEL makes no change.</note>in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.

You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long cord. Just so, from the ship’s steep side, did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both ends; fast to Queequeg’s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow leather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated <ref target="#ref_20073">Siamese ligature</ref><note xml:id="ref_20073">Siamese ligature: Born in Siam (now Thailand) of Chinese heritage <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:352" type="person">Chang and Eng Bunker</name> (1811-1874) were conjoined twins attached at the sternum; they were such a sensation when exhibited as “the Siamese Twins” in Europe and the Americas beginning in 1829, that the name for their condition has persisted.</note> united us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two: that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that another’s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of<ref target="#ref_20075"> interregnum</ref><note xml:id="ref_20075">interregnum: gap in continuity of rule.</note> in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have sanctioned so gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering—while I jerked him now and then from between the whale and the ship, which would threaten to jam him—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1471300800510-xg17kve5ag-90783bc53b211b9d7e95449f4eb6318a%2FMD_Amer_0394.jpg"/>apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg’s monkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I only had the management of one end of it.*

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale and the ship—where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before <ref target="#ref_20076">pent</ref><note xml:id="ref_20076">pent: shut in.</note> blood which began to flow from the carcase—the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them. Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark—he was provided with still another protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen

* [Melville's Note] The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb, in order to afford to the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder.

This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg’s best happiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-mudded water, those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there with that great iron hook—poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters it, after all?

Either Melville or an editor may have made the change. Historically, women played an active role in the whaling industry, mostly behind a desk at home but also at sea as captains’ wives. But the particular fictional world of the Pequod is entirely male (with such exceptions as Aunt Charity, imagined dancing females in Ch. 40, a mention of Ahab’s wife, and Madame Leviathan in Ch. 87), and the possibility that Melville might have removed “men” in order to make “each and all of us” include both genders, though remote, is worth consideration. However, in keeping with its policy of not mixing versions, MEL does not drop the word.

That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now, as with blue lips and bloodshot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent, consolatory glance hands him—what? Some hot Cogniac? No! hands him, ye gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Ginger? Do I smell ginger?” suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near. “Yes, this must be ginger,” peering into the as yet untasted cup.

The joke is that after risking his life on the monkey-rope, Queequeg is offered something like ginger ale to warm him up. Ginger was a common home-remedy for indigestion, and Stubb playfully compares the steward Dough-Boy to an apothecary (druggist), who, in the American reading, dispenses “bitters” (that is, mildly alcoholic medications for stomachache and de-worming) in order to restore “life.” In the British version, however, the apothecary uses a “bellows” as a life-saving device that puts new “breath” into the half-drowned man. The NN editors follow the British version, arguing only that “breath” is the “more appropriate word” (NN <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi>, 790).
