Though probably a typo, the missing word may convey a significantly different meaning. Whereas “the eager mariners” implies that all the crew of the Pequod are eager; “eager mariners” may mean only those of the crew who are eager. Since Ahab’s success depends upon the eagerness of the entire crew, the dropped “the” might suggest some dissent, an important matter in the final chapters.

In good time the order came. It was hard upon high noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude.

Indeed, most of <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi> is set in waters the author never sailed. In the revised sheets he sent to England, Melville almost certainly inserted the important qualifier “sometimes” after “Now,” as a hedge on his statement (personally unverifiable given his limited experience) concerning the “days in summer” in that Japanese sea.

That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy ocean’s immeasurable burning-glass. The sky looks lacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of God’s throne. Well that Ahab’s <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1519947860126-jciz041xbe-c0830a794050bd70f9474a69ee39b5a2%2FMD_Amer_0590.jpg"/> <ref target="#ref_18613">quadrant</ref><note xml:id="ref_18613">quadrant: “A reflecting instrument used to [measure] the altitude above the horizon of the sun, moon, or stars at sea, and thereby to determine the latitude and longitude [of a ship’s position]” (<ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/text:198"><hi rend="italic">Sailor's Word-Book</hi></ref>).</note> was furnished with colored glasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise <ref target="#ref_18605">meridian</ref><note xml:id="ref_18605">meridian: highest point in the sky; local noon.</note>. Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship’s deck, and with face thrown up like Ahab’s, was eyeing the same sun with him; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face was <ref target="#MD118Note3">subdued to an <hi rend="bold">earthly</hi> passionlessness</ref><note xml:id="MD118Note3">REVISION NARRATIVE: subdued to an <hi rend="bold">earthly</hi> passionlessness //  The British edition alteration of “earthly” to “unearthly” may be an authorial correction or revision. That is, Melville may have originally intended “unearthly,” but his American typesetter dropped the “un-,” and Melville used the British edition to correct the American typo to “unearthly.” Or he may have intended “earthly” and changed his mind to “unearthly.” In either event, the change is significant. The Parsee (Fedallah) is dark and racialized, hence, arguably “earthly”; however, he is also ominous and remote, hence “unearthly.” In this scene, his “wild face” transforms into a “passionlessness” so that we in fact witness both his “earthly” and “unearthly” attributes. The use of any modifier (earthly or unearthly) allows for a subtle modulation of Fedallah’s character and the change to “unearthly” at this point in the narrative stresses his more ethereal potential, in keeping with his prophetic role as Ahab approaches his fated end.

At length the desired observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant. Then falling into a moment’s revery, he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself: “Thou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly where I am—but canst thou cast the least hint where I shall be? Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living? Where is Moby Dick? This instant thou must be eyeing him. These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him; aye, and into the eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered: “Foolish toy! babies’ plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores, and Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but what after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that holds thee: no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell where one drop of water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy impotence thou insultest the sun! Science!

Speed is measured by the “log line,” a marked rope with a piece of wood at the end that is thrown overboard. The line unreels for a set time, and the length unreeled by then indicates the speed. It is described and used in Ch. 125.</note>; these shall conduct me, and show me my place on the sea. Aye,” lighting from the boat to the deck, “thus I trample on thee, thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high; thus I split and destroy thee!”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself—these passed over the mute, motionless Parsee’s face. Unobserved he rose and glided away; while, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered together on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck, shouted out—“To the braces! Up helm!—<ref target="#ref_18606">square in</ref><note xml:id="ref_18606">square in: turn the yards (and their sails) at right angles to the vessel, in order to sail directly before the wind.</note>!”

Given Melville’s Shakespeareanisms (as in “Down, dog, and kennel” in Ch. 29) and the peculiarities of Stubb’s diction, the barely grammatical expression might be intended. The NN edition considers the wording to be one of many “mistakes in typesetting” (792) and emends it to “and die in it,” which is only one of several possible emendations. MEL makes no change.</note>!”
