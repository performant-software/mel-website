So, it being calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh to his endless end.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown; dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the higher you rise the harder you toil.

To be short, among whalemen, the harpooneers are the holders, so called.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should have stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where, stripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well. And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor pagan; where, strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last, after some days’ suffering, laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill of the door of death. How he wasted and wasted away in those few long-lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing. But as all else in him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing fuller and fuller; they became of a strange softness of lustre; and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die, or be weakened. And like circles on the water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity. An awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any beheld who were bystanders when <ref target="#ref_18541">Zoroaster</ref><note xml:id="ref_18541">Zoroaster: Persian founder of the Zoroastrian, or Parsi, religion, who lived ca. 628–551 BCE.</note> died.

And the drawing near of <ref target="#MDch110Note2">Death, which alike levels all, <hi rend="bold">alike</hi> impresses all</ref><note xml:id="MDch110Note2">REVISION NARRATIVE: Death, which alike levels all, <hi rend="bold">alike</hi> impresses all //
The repetition of "alike" creates a halting rhythm that underscores the idea that every person not only dies but also has at the end a special revelation. This stressed commonality regarding Death also validates Queequeg’s final vision. However, in the British edition, the second "alike" has been cut. The reason is not clear: the deletion could be an editorial intervention, an authorial revision, or Melville’s correction of an error.
<lb/>
<lb/>Ignoring the rhetorical effectiveness of the repetition of “alike,” a British editor might have intervened, assuming that the second “alike” was grammatically unnecessary. Just as likely is that Melville might have revised by requesting the cut in the sheets he sent to England because he no longer felt that the halting rhythm was effective. A third possibility is that the repetition was an error in the American version to begin with, which Melville corrected. That is, Melville may have originally written “death, which levels all, alike impresses all” with only one "alike" in manuscript and then repositioned that single word so that it would appear before “levels” instead of “impresses all.” In this scenario, Melville's copyist or an American printer misread the revised manuscript, inserting "alike" before "levels" but failing to delete the still-visible “alike” in “alike impresses,” thus creating an unwanted repetition. By removing the second "alike" for the British edition, Melville would have corrected his text to its intended revised state.

The sentence also evokes such biblical phrasings as “And he called them unto him” (Mark 3.23), or “Jesus called them unto him” (Luke 18.16). More specifically, “in the morning watch” occurs three times in the Bible (Exodus 14.24, 1 Samuel 11.11, Judith [Apocrypha] 12.5).</note>, when the day was just breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich war-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned that all whalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark canoes, and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for it was not unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a dead warrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the stars are isles, but that far beyond all visible horizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form <ref target="#MDch110Note3">the white breakers of <hi rend="bold">the milky way.

<lb/>
<lb/>In this passage, Ishmael relates that Queequeg “called one to him” (presumably Ishmael himself) and “said” that he had observed the use of coffins for burial in Nantucket, which “was not unlike” the Polynesian custom of setting corpses adrift in canoes. In effect, Ishmael is relating Queequeg’s words through indirect dialogue, and for the most part balances Queequeg’s diction (“dark canoes”) with his own (“starry archipelagoes”). But as he proceeds, Ishmael’s idiom begins to dominate: “for not only do they believe that the stars are isles [Queequeg’s diction], but that far beyond all visible horizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form the white breakers of the milky way” [Ishmael’s diction]. Melville’s insertion of “after saying this” clearly assigns such Ishmaelean words as “visible horizons,” “mild, uncontinented seas,” and “interflow” to Queequeg, thus, essentially blending the two consciousnesses.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter was at once commanded to do Queequeg’s bidding, whatever it might include.

No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and took Quee-<pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1519770628704-8eacskr66v7-751bab258f99d3d7a7c3d3df7d791a37%2FMD_Amer_0569.jpg"/>queg’s measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg’s person as he shifted the rule.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Ah! poor fellow! he’ll have to die now,” ejaculated the Long Island sailor.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience’ sake and general reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its extremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his tools, and to work.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one’s consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be indulged.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also, biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he called it) to be placed over him. The head part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1519770632940-d4dznjvf3ak-751bab258f99d3d7a7c3d3df7d791a37%2FMD_Amer_0570.jpg"/> but his composed countenance in view. “Rarmai” (it will do; it is easy), he murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in his hammock.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all this while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took him by the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? where go ye now?

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“I have heard,” murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, “that in violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues; and that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor Pip, in this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes.

Pip Going Down 1 //
One of three changes in the British edition, certainly made by Melville, to alter the tone of the concluding lines in Pip’s elegy for Queequeg. Imagining Queequeg to be a valiant “General,” the mad cabin boy considers himself unworthy of anything but shame; he is “drowned” and has already “died” (spiritually) because of what he takes to have been his cowardice in jumping from the whaleboat in Ch. 93, “The Castaway.” In revising this passage, Melville removed “once more” to give simply “if he were dying here.” The deletion seems warranted if only because one dies only once, but in Pip's mind his spiritual death is a metaphorical dying that would permit a second physical death.  That nuance, however, is lost with the deletion of "once more." See also "them" and "go drown" in this passage.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon there seemed no need of the carpenter’s box: and thereupon, when some expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this;—at a critical moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone; and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet, he averred. They asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a word, it was Queequeg’s conceit, that if a man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized; that while a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing, generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there.

And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his, when one morning turning away from surveying poor Queequeg—“Oh, devilish tantalization of the gods!”</p></div></body>
