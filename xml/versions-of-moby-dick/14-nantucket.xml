Some <ref target="#ref_16088">gamesome wights</ref><note xml:id="ref_16088">gamesome wights: humorous people.</note> will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they don’t grow naturally; that they import <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:120" type="place">Canada</name> thistles; that they have to send beyond seas for a <ref target="#ref_16089">spile</ref><note xml:id="ref_16089">spile: wooden plug.</note> to stop a leak in an oil cask; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:8" type="place">Rome</name>; that people there plant toadstools before their houses, to get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an oasis, three blades in a day’s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes, something like <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:219" type="place">Laplander</name> snow-shoes; that they are so shut up, belted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle swooped down upon the <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:304" type="place">New England</name> coast, and carried off an infant Indian in his talons.

They resolved to follow in the same direction. Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage they discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory casket,—the poor little Indian’s skeleton.

For the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a right of way through it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though following the sea as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself.

With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.
