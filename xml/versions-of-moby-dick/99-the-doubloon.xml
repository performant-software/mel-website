THE DOUBLOON

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">ERE now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck, taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood, he was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him. When he halted before the binnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast, then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a certain wild longing, if not hopefulness.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly attracted by the <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:1117" type="artwork">strange figures</name> and inscriptions stamped on it, as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them. And some certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are little worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell by the cartload, as they do <ref target="#ref_20227"><name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:238" type="place">hills about Boston</name></ref><note xml:id="ref_20227">as they do hills about Boston: From 1807 to 1835, Boston’s steep Mount Vernon, Beacon Hill, and Pemberton Hill were leveled and their earth used for landfill to expand and connect the city’s different landmasses.</note>, to fill up some morass in the Milky Way.

Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however wanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale’s <ref target="#ref_27562">talisman</ref><note xml:id="ref_27562">talisman: object marked with mystic signs to avert evil.</note>. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night, wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever live to spend it.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It so chanced that the <ref target="#ref_27565">doubloon of the Pequod</ref><note xml:id="ref_27565">doubloon of the Pequod: In describing the coin, Melville omitted some of the symbols that appear on an actual Ecuadorian doubloon, and apparently misperceived others; editors of Moby-Dick have misidentified some of the symbols as well. An official decree of 1836 specifies the details of the eight escudo coin, also called a doubloon, issued in 1838: “on the obverse it will have . . . the zodiac or the ecliptic. . . . To the right will be the two principal mountains that make up the Pichincha mountain chain; on the first point the Guagua Pichincha on which will rest a condor [not a cock as in Moby-Dick] and on the second the Ruco Pichincha volcano [smoking, not flame-topped]. To the left of the shield will be engraved a cliff [not a mountain summit], on it a tower and on this will be placed another condor [not mentioned in the text] that will face the one that is on the peak to the right. The inscription will be REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR—QUITO, placed perpendicularly below the sun . . .” (trans. Stephen Grimsley). Not specified by the decree are the signs of the zodiac Melville describes, two on each side of the central, “keystone” sun. From left to right they are Leo, Virgo, Libra, and Scorpio.</note> was a most wealthy example of these things. On its round border it bore the letters, REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO. So this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world, and beneath the great equator, and named after it; and it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn. Zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three Andes’ summits; from one a flame; a tower on another; on the third a crowing cock; while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac, the signs all marked with their usual <ref target="#ref_27564">cabalistics</ref><note xml:id="ref_27564">cabalistics: hidden meanings, but here the symbols associated with of the signs of the zodiac. </note>, and the keystone sun entering the <ref target="#ref_27566">equinoctial point at Libra</ref><note xml:id="ref_27566">equinoctial point at Libra: Astrologically, the autumnal equinox in the Northern Hemisphere occurs as the sun is entering the constellation Libra, the Scales.</note>.

Great pains, small gains for those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself.

So in this vale of Death,  God girds us round; and over all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope. If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil; but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to cheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at midnight, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain! This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me. I will quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.”
