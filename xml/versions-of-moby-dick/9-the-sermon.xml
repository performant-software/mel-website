</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><hi rend="smallcaps">Father</hi> Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense. “<ref target="#ref_15815">Starboard gangway, there</ref><note xml:id="ref_15815">Starboard gangway, there!: Like an officer at sea, Mapple commands his parishioners on the right to move left, those on the left to move right, all toward the middle.</note>!  side away to larboard—larboard gangway to starboard!

<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the howling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon the proper page, said: “Beloved shipmates, <ref target="#ref_15779">clinch</ref><note xml:id="ref_15779">clinch: seize tightly.</note> the last verse of the first chapter of <ref target="#ref_21250">Jonah</ref><note xml:id="ref_21250">Jonah: Mapple retells the familiar biblical story in the Book of Jonah, Chs. 1–2, and quotes scripture with only minor variations, such as “And God had prepared” instead of “Now the Lord had prepared” in the passage quoted here (Jonah 1.17). On two occasions (cited below in notes), Melville draws from Jonah without using quotation marks.</note>—‘And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.’

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters—four yarns—is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah’s deep sea-line sound! what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that <ref target="#ref_15780">canticle</ref><note xml:id="ref_15780">canticle: religious song or chant.</note> in the fish’s belly! How <ref target="#ref_15781">billow-like</ref><note xml:id="ref_15781">billow-like: wavelike.</note> and boisterously grand! We feel the floods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But what is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a <ref target="#ref_21251">pilot</ref><note xml:id="ref_21251">pilot of the living God: spiritual guide.</note> of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of God—never mind now what that command was, or how conveyed—which he found a hard command. But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do—remember that—and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517780848391-wp0gzbjgl7-ceb526224831a906747b7ecadac90f57%2FMD_Amer_0083.jpg"/> we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further <ref target="#ref_15783">flouts at</ref><note xml:id="ref_15783">flouts at: scorns.</note> God, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men, will carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the Captains of this earth. He skulks about the wharves of <ref target="#ref_16035">Joppa</ref><note xml:id="ref_16035">Joppa . . . Tarshish: Joppa is now Jaffa, a district of Tel Aviv, Israel.</note>, and seeks a ship that’s bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern <ref target="#MDch9note1">Cadiz</ref><note xml:id="MDch9note1">Cadiz: or Tarshish is on the Atlantic coast of Spain.</note>. That’s the opinion of learned men. And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the <ref target="#ref_15784">Straits of Gibraltar</ref><note xml:id="ref_15784">Straits of Gibraltar: connecting the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea.</note>. See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God? Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he’s a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat box, valise, or carpet-bag,—no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger’s evil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517780960626-rjypuwufrxa-ceb526224831a906747b7ecadac90f57%2FMD_Amer_0084.jpg"/> man assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but still serious way, one whispers to the other—‘Jack, he’s robbed a widow;’ or, ‘Joe, do you mark him; he’s a bigamist;’ or, ‘Harry lad, I guess he’s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing murderers from Sodom.’ Another runs to read the bill that’s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a <ref target="#ref_15785">parricide</ref><note xml:id="ref_15785">parricide: killer of one’s parent.</note>, and containing a description of his person. He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him pass, and he descends into the cabin.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“‘Who’s there?’ cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making out his papers for the Customs—‘Who’s there?’ Oh! how that harmless question mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again. But he rallies. ‘I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon sail ye, sir?’ Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. ‘We sail with the next coming tide,’ at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing him. ‘No sooner, sir?’—‘Soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger.’ Ha! Jonah, that’s another stab. But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent. ‘I’ll sail with ye,’—he says,—‘the passage money, how much is that?—I’ll pay now.’ For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history, ‘that he paid the fare thereof’ ere the craft did sail. And taken with the context, this is full of meaning.
<pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517780981948-vhrwhm1brj-ceb526224831a906747b7ecadac90f57%2FMD_Amer_0085.jpg"/>
</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Now Jonah’s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects crime in any, but whose <ref target="#ref_15786">cupidity</ref><note xml:id="ref_15786">cupidity: greed.</note> exposes it only in the penniless. In this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers. So Jonah’s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah’s purse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum; and it’s assented to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit. Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his passage. ‘Point out my state-room, Sir,’ says Jonah now, ‘I’m travel-weary; I need sleep.’ ‘Thou look’st like it,’ says the Captain, ‘there’s thy room.’ Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock contains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the doors of convicts’ cells being never allowed to be locked within. All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship’s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowel’s wards.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in Jonah’s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it hung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance. But that <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517780994262-uftepeokeuq-ceb526224831a906747b7ecadac90f57%2FMD_Amer_0086.jpg"/> contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor, the ceiling, and the side, are all awry. ‘Oh! so my conscience hangs in me!’ he groans, ‘straight upward, so it burns; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness!’

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and there’s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth, Jonah’s <ref target="#ref_15787">prodigy</ref><note xml:id="ref_15787">prodigy: something evoking awe; here, awful burden.</note> of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening, glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers! the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not bear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to break. But now when the <ref target="#ref_15788"><ref type="reference" target="glossary#boatswain"><w xml:id="boatswain">boatswain</w></ref></ref><note xml:id="ref_15788">boatswain: pronounced bos’n, a subordinate ship’s officer.</note> calls all hands to lighten her; when <ref target="#MDrnNote3">boxes, bales, and jars are <hi rend="bold">clattering</hi> overboard</ref><note xml:id="MDrnNote3">REVISION NARRATIVE: boxes, bales, and jars are <hi rend="bold">clattering</hi> overboard // The word “clattering” is revised to “tumbling” in the British edition, probably by Melville.

He sees no black sky and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is <ref target="#ref_15789">cleaving</ref><note xml:id="ref_15789">cleaving: cutting through.</note> the seas after him.

But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead ear, ‘What meanest thou, O sleeper! arise!’ Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517781018039-rep1vc8b5o9-ceb526224831a906747b7ecadac90f57%2FMD_Amer_0087.jpg"/> feet, and stumbling to the deck, grasps a <ref target="#ref_15791">shroud</ref><note xml:id="ref_15791">shroud: heavy rope supporting a mast. </note>, to look out upon the sea. But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his cringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The sailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to high Heaven, they fall to <ref target="#ref_15792">casting lots</ref><note xml:id="ref_15792">casting lots: choosing by throwing dice or drawing straws.</note>, to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them. The lot is Jonah’s; that discovered, then how furiously they mob him with their questions. ‘What is thine occupation? Whence comest thou? Thy country? What people?’ But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer to those questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“‘I am a Hebrew,’ he cries—and then—‘I fear the Lord the God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!’ Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well mightest thou fear the Lord God then! Straightway, he now goes on to make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled, but still are <ref target="#ref_15793">pitiful</ref><note xml:id="ref_15793">pitiful: pitying.</note>. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his <ref target="#ref_15794">deserts</ref><note xml:id="ref_15794">deserts: deserved punishment. </note>,—when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for his sake this great tempest was upon them; they mercifully <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517781037685-2v0fny5gqra-ceb526224831a906747b7ecadac90f57%2FMD_Amer_0088.jpg"/> turn from him, and seek by other means to save the ship. But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder; then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea; when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water behind. He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale <ref target="#ref_15795">shoots-to</ref><note xml:id="ref_15795">shoots-to: closes.</note> all his ivory teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. <ref target="#ref_21253">Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish’s belly</ref><note xml:id="ref_21253">Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish’s belly: Jonah 2.1</note>. But observe his prayer, and learn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment. And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a model for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking, slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who, when describing Jonah’s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself. His deep chest heaved as with a <ref target="#ref_15797">ground-swell</ref><note xml:id="ref_15797">ground-swell: long, rolling waves.</note>; his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the leaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with closed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly, with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these words:

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press upon me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to me, for I am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come down from this mast-head and sit on the <ref target="#ref_16024">hatches</ref><note xml:id="ref_16024">hatches: coverings for the hatchways, or openings in the deck of a ship.</note> there where you sit, and listen as you listen, while some one of you reads me that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to me, as a pilot of the living God.

But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never reached. As we have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him along ‘into the midst of the seas,’ where the eddying depths sucked him <ref target="#ref_16025">ten thousand fathoms</ref><note xml:id="ref_16025">ten thousand fathoms down: a fathom is six feet; Mapple is exaggerating for effect.</note> down, and <ref target="#ref_21254">‘the weeds were wrapped about his head,’</ref><note xml:id="ref_21254">‘the weeds were wrapped about his head,’: The wording is “wrapped about my head” in Jonah 2:5.

Yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet—‘out of the belly of hell’—when the whale grounded upon the ocean’s utmost bones, even then, God heard the engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then God spake unto the fish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and earth; and ‘<name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:930" type="artwork">vomited out</name> Jonah upon the dry land;’ when the word of <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517781068896-8no1zv9lvxj-ceb526224831a906747b7ecadac90f57%2FMD_Amer_0090.jpg"/> the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and beaten—his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean—Jonah did the Almighty’s bidding. And what was that, shipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That was it!

Mapple’s references to Paul in nautical terms as both a “Pilot” and “castaway” acknowledge his role as a spiritual guide. In 1 Corinthians 9:27, Paul states: “But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.” Compare Ch. 26 (“meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways”), and Ch. 93, “The Castaway.”</note> has it, while preaching to others is himself a castaway!”
