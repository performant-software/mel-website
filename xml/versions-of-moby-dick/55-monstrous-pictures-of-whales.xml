<note xml:id="ref_21827">Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales: According to Mansfield and Vincent's Hendricks House edition of <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi>, the chapter title draws from two sources: <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/text:126"><hi rend="italic">Pseudodoxia Epidemica</hi></ref> (1646) by English physician Sir Thomas Browne (1605–1682) and popularly called <hi rend="italic">Vulgar Errors</hi>, which includes “Of Many Things Questionable as They are Commonly Described in Pictures” (Book 5); and <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/text:182"><hi rend="italic">A History and Description of the Northern Whale Fishery</hi></ref> (1820) by William Scoresby Jr., which distinguishes between true and false pictures of whales.</note>

Melville may have read about Saladin in Sir Walter Scott’s chivalric novel <hi rend="italic">The Talisman</hi> (1825). The reference here is to Saladin's chain-mail armor. During his 1849 visit to the Horse Armoury at the Tower of London, Melville admired “some fine Turkish armor (chain)” (NN <hi rend="italic">Journals</hi> 15, 275). Though Saladin was not a Turk, Melville may have had the image of Turkish chain armor in mind as he incorporated Saladin's armor in the depictions of dolphins.</note>, and a <ref target="#ref_20031">helmeted head like St. George's</ref><note xml:id="ref_20031">helmeted head like St. George’s: <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:923">St. George</ref> was the late third-century Roman soldier and Christian from Cappadocia (in present-day Turkey) who defied Emperor Diocletian’s order to persecute Christians and was himself tortured and martyred. The patron saint of England and Portugal, St. George is most often depicted in medieval armor slaying a dragon. (In this regard, see Perseus and Andromeda in note below.) Images of St. George's <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:924">helmet in the form of a dolphin mask</ref> are abundant, though Melville might have known of the "helmeted head" from his reading.</note>; ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific presentations of him.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whale’s, is to be found in the famous <ref target="#ref_21834">cavern-pagoda of Elephanta</ref><note xml:id="ref_21834"><ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:943">cavern-pagoda of Elephanta</ref>: Located on the island of Gharapuri in Mumbai (old Bombay) Harbor, the caves of Elephanta, sculpted out of the hillsides, are a network of a large group of five Hindu caves and a smaller group of two Buddhist caves. Sculptures in the Hindu caves carved by the Shaiva sect are dedicated to the god Shiva. (See also note on Elephanta in Ch.7)</note>, in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall, depicting the incarnation of <ref target="#ref_21836">Vishnu</ref><note xml:id="ref_21836">Vishnu: one of the principal deities of Hinduism</note> in the form of leviathan, learnedly known as the

As Vincent notes in <hi rend="italic">The Trying-Out of Moby-Dick</hi>, the caves of Elephanta do not contain a sculpture of the “Matse Avatar”: “Melville’s error, if such it be, probably occurred from hasty reading in [Thomas] Maurice’s <hi rend="italic">Indian Antiquities</hi> where Maurice passes rapidly, without adequate transition, from a description of the Cave of Elephanta to an account of the Matse Avatar” (280). Although there is no direct evidence that Melville read <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/text:249"><hi rend="italic">Indian Antiquities</hi></ref>, its engraving of the <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:925">Matse Avatar</ref> bears a strong resemblance to Melville’s description. See also, Bruce M. Sullivan and Patricia Wong Hall, "<ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/text:248">The Whale Avatar of the Hindoos in Melville’s Moby Dick</ref>."</note>. But though this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong. It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the broad palms of the true whale’s majestic flukes.

In the famous painting of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea-monster by Renaissance Italian Guido Reni (1575–1642), Greek hero Perseus, riding Pegasus, slays the sea-dragon that is about to devour the sacrificial Andromeda, chained to the rocks by her father King Cepheus. Other references to the Perseus myth occur in Chs. 28 and 82.

<note xml:id="ref_20035">Hogarth . . . “Perseus Descending”: The works of English painter and printmaker William Hogarth (1697-1764) were widely available to nineteenth-century Americans, and Melville may have seen examples of his works during his 1849 visit to London. He refers to Andromeda’s rescue again in his unpublished poem “Naples in the Time of Bomba.” Hogarth's somewhat comic rendering of the rescue of Andromeda, "<ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:926">Perseus Descending</ref>,” appears as an illustration for Lewis Theobald’s verse drama <hi rend="italic">Perseus and Andromeda</hi> (London, 1730).</note> make out one whit better.

Then, there are the <ref target="#ref_20562">Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald</ref><note xml:id="ref_20562">Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald: Melville's "Prodromus whales" is a conflation of two sources by Scottish physician, historian, and naturalist Sir Robert Sibbald (1641–1722). Sibbald's <hi rend="italic">Scotia Illustrata; Sive Prodromus Naturalis in quo Regionis Natura</hi> (1683), informally called Sibbald’s <hi rend="italic">Prodromus</hi> (i.e. his Introduction), does not, in fact, include pictures of whales. Instead, the <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:929"><ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:945">illustrations that Melville refers to</ref></ref> appear (not surprisingly) in Sibbald's book on whales: <hi rend="italic">Phalainologia Nova; Sive Observationes de Rarioribus quibusdam Balaenis in Scotiae Littus Nuper Ejectus</hi> (1692). In short, Melville's phrase draws "Prodromus" from one book and "whales" from another. Melville's confusion did not come from any lack of familiarity with Sibbald. The Melville family celebrated its Scotch lineage, and the Melville family library probably included his 1710 <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/text:140"><hi rend="italic">History of Fife and Kinross</hi></ref>, which treats the region of Scotland where Melville’s grandfather was raised, and which Melville quotes in "Extracts." Even so, according to Frank’s <hi rend="italic">Herman Melville's Picture Gallery</hi>, Melville could have also been exposed to Sibbald's whale images through other, more readily available sources—Bonnaterre, Lacépède, Desmarest—which reprinted Sibbald’s plates. Whether Melville knew Sibbald directly or second-hand, his confusion in the conflated phrase "Prodromus whales" is forgiveable.</note>, and <ref target="#ref_20038">Jonah’s whale</ref><note xml:id="ref_20038"><name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:930" type="artwork">Jonah’s whale</name>: Like most children of his day, Melville’s first acquaintance with depictions of the whale was through antiquated illustrations from the book of Jonah, appearing in Bibles well into the nineteenth century, and through similar <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:931" type="artwork">pictures in children’s primers</name> such as the <hi rend="italic">New England Primer</hi>, quoted in “Extracts.”</note>, as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers.

As for the <ref target="#ref_20039">book-binder’s whale</ref> winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor—as stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both old and new—that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique vases.

The figure also appears in one of Melville’s sources, Sir Thomas Browne's <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/text:126"><hi rend="italic">Pseudodoxia Epidemica (Vulgar Errors)</hi></ref>, but Ishmael takes issue with Browne and all others by facetiously claiming that the creature represented was intended to be a whale. Ishmael’s conclusion that dolphins are “popularly supposed to be a species of the Leviathan” also implies, contrary to fact, that dolphins are not cetaceans (whales). But as the NN editors suggest, this distinction is in keeping with Ishmael’s “cetology.” Whereas “dolphin” and “porpoise” are words used for the same cetacean creature related to all whales, Ishmael reserves the word “porpoise” in Ch. 32, exclusively for these smaller cetaceans and may have taken the word “dolphin” to indicate the fish of the same name, noted among sailors and poets for changing color when dying.</note> an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended when the device was first introduced. It was introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the Leviathan.

Not at all. For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan, that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. Though <ref target="#ref_20053">Jeremy Bentham’s skeleton</ref><note xml:id="ref_20053">Bentham’s skeleton . . . one of his executors: In his will, British utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) requested that his mummified head and clothed skeleton be preserved and put <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:942">on display as an “Auto-Icon”</ref> to encourage others to strive for greatness. His executor, the physician Southwood Smith, followed his instructions but mangled the head; a wax head was fashioned, and the auto-icon was seated in a glass and mahogany case with the original head in a hat box at Jeremy’s feet. The display remained at Smith’s lodgings until it was transferred in 1850 to the University of London, where it remains on view. Melville does not mention visiting Smith’s library in his journal of his trip to London in 1849, but the story of Bentham’s auto-icon was common knowledge. Ishmael’s remark that the skeleton was used as a candelabra is facetious, but may owe something to Edgar Allan Poe’s story “King Pest” (1835), in which, at a banquet, a fire is kindled in the skull of a skeleton hanging overhead; see Burton R.

Melville is not likely to have made this revision as it spoils a good joke; chances are an editor changed the text for the sake of accuracy and out of respect for Bentham’s reputation, if not his somewhat egocentric monument.

This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in <ref target="#ref_19884">some part of this book</ref><note xml:id="ref_19884">some part of this book: See Chs. 74–80.</note> will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously displayed in the side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the thumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger. But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human fingers in an artificial covering. “However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,” said humorous Stubb one day, “he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last. <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1471212085540-z2gm99hj05-571e33d81c99dd3af294d6cdbcbff8d5%2FMD_Amer_0335.jpg"/> True, one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan.</p></div></body>
