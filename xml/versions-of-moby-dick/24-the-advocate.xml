				<head type="sub-head" rend="center"><ref target="#ref_16293">THE ADVOCATE</ref></head><note xml:id="ref_16293">The Advocate: An advocate is a lawyer. Much of this chapter's information is drawn heavily from Ch. 11 of Thomas Beale, <hi rend="italic">The Natural History of the Sperm Whale</hi> (1839), with minor borrowings from William Scoresby, <hi rend="italic">An Account of the Northern Whale Fishery</hi> (1820) and J. Ross Browne, <hi rend="italic">Etchings of a Whaling Cruise</hi> (1849). See also Mansfield and Vincent's note in their Hendricks House edition of <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi>.</note>

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">AS Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling; and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I am all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517870360943-t1z3a2yxa7-594920d28f82410c60b3463b989fac1b%2FMD_Amer_0156.jpg"/> establish the fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions. If a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society, it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were he presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials S. W. F. (Sperm Whale Fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us whalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged therein, we are surrounded by all manner of defilements. Butchers we are, that is true. But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor. And as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But even granting the charge in question to be true; what disordered slippery decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies’ plaudits? And if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier’s profession; let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery, would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale’s vast tail, fanning into eddies the air over his head. For what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of God!

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But, though the world <ref target="#ref_16309">scouts at</ref><note xml:id="ref_16309">scouts at: scorns; derides.</note> us whale hunters, yet does it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding adoration! for almost all the tapers, lamps, and <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517870366693-540dvcmqjli-594920d28f82410c60b3463b989fac1b%2FMD_Amer_0157.jpg"/> candles that burn round the globe, burn, as before so many shrines, to our glory!

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of scales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.

Why did Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of £1,000,000? And lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned by eighteen thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth, at the time of sailing, $20,000,000; and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000. How comes all this, if there be not something <ref target="#ref_16312">puissant</ref><note xml:id="ref_16312">puissant: powerful.</note> in whaling?

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But this is not the half; look again.

Melville announces this liberal perspective in “Etymology” when he has his pale Usher using “a queer handkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the known nations of the world” to dust his books. Because certain adventurers, at least one famous itinerant preacher (Lorenzo Dow), and various shady business men adopted the pose of “Cosmopolite” in their dealings, the word acquired additional, more ambiguous meanings in Melville’s day, a fact he exploits by calling Frank Goodman, the main character of <hi rend="italic">The Confidence-Man</hi>, a “cosmopolitan.”</note> cannot, for his life, point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken in one aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling. One way and another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues, that whaling may well be regarded as that <ref target="#ref_21651">Egyptian mother</ref><note xml:id="ref_21651">Egyptian mother . . . womb: In Egyptian mythology, Nut is the mother of the twins Osiris and Isis.

Charles Wilkes; Captain James Cook (1728–1779) and Captain George Vancouver (1758–1798) were the most famous eighteenth-century explorers of the Pacific; Adam Johann Krusenstern (1770–1846) was the first Russian circumnavigator. The American edition misspelled "Cook" as "Cooke" here and elsewhere in this chapter; the British corrected the error; as do the MEL and NN editions.</note>; but I say that scores of anonymous Captains have sailed out of Nantucket, that were as great, and greater than your Cook and your Krusenstern.  For in their succorless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, <ref target="#ref_16313">javelin</ref><note xml:id="ref_16313">javelin: here, spear-filled.</note> islands, battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have dared.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial, scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe and the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast.

Melville's Version of Beale 1: jealous policy // Thomas Beale’s <hi rend="italic">Natural History of the Sperm Whale</hi> was a major source of information for Melville, and on occasion he borrowed Beale’s wording without acknowledgment. In paraphrasing Beale, he often revised Beale's intended meanings. As a form of revision, Melville's unacknowledged appropriation is essentially one author’s version of another author, and therefore a kind of fluid text. Such unacknowledged appropriation can be seen in Melville’s phrase, “the jealous policy of the Spanish crown,” which is lifted from Beale’s phrase, “so meanly jealous was Spain of the interference of foreigners” (see Beale, ch. 11, p. 146). In two passages in the following paragraph, Melville’s version of Beale may be read as a subtle disparagement of Beale's too sunny praise of imperialism. (See notes on "benevolent biscuit" and "primitive missionaries," below.) For Melville's annotated copy of Beale, see Melville's Marginalia Online at http://melvillesmarginalia.org.</note>, touching those colonies; and, if space permitted, it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain, and the establishment of the <ref target="#ref_20625">eternal democracy</ref><note xml:id="ref_20625">liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain: Chile became independent from Spanish colonial rule in 1818, Peru in 1824, and Bolivia in 1825.

Melville's Version of Beale 2: benevolent biscuit // Melville’s rephrasing of Beale here may be a concealed sarcasm of the source. In his discussion of the role of whaling in supporting Pacific colonization, Beale praises the whalers' charity: "It is a fact, that the original settlers at Botany Bay were more than once saved from <hi rend="italic">starvation</hi> by the timely arrival of some whaling vessels" [Ch. 11, p. 147; Beale's italics].

Melville's Version of Beale 3: primitive missionaries // On the surface, the use of "primitive" in this curious phrase refers only to the missionaries who first arrive, but it also implies a negative characterization of the missionaries as primitive in behavior, or uncivilized. In fact, the phrasing seems a deliberate snubbing of missionaries. To create this phrase, Melville extracts Beale’s word “primitive” (referring to settlers) from one passage and attaches it to “missionaries” in a passage from the next paragraph; both words are highlighted in bold in the passage quoted here:
<lb/><lb/>"But our whaling vessels, cruising for whales, examined their shores and brought home information respecting their value, and . . . carried out people to reside upon them, and established a regular communication between them and our own country—by which the wants of the <hi rend="bold">primitive</hi> settlers could be supplied. . . .
