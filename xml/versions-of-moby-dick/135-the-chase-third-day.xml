</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“D’ye see him?” cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that’s <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1471323082941-b4ob01ny2nv-89f1168568c9be30934c171871c8f1c7%2FMD_Amer_0659.jpg"/> all. Helm there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely day again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a fairer day could not dawn upon that world. Here’s food for thought, had Ahab time to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels; that’s tingling enough for mortal man! to think’s audacity. God only has that right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, <ref target="#ref_20187">a coolness and a calmness</ref><note xml:id="ref_20187">Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a calmness: Ahab echoes Melville’s complaint in a June [?], 1851 letter to Hawthorne: “The calm, the coolness, the silent grass-growing mood in which a man ought always to compose,—that, I fear, can seldom be mine. Dollars damn me.”</note>; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for that. And yet, I’ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm—frozen calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents turn to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is growing now; this moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it’s like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds blow it; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to. A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces. Out upon it!—it’s tainted. Were I the wind, I’d blow no more on such a wicked, miserable world. I’d crawl somewhere to a cave, and slink there. And yet, ’tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who ever conquered it? In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow. Run tilting at it, and you but run through it. Ha! a coward wind that strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow. Even Ahab is a braver thing—a nobler thing than that. Would now the wind but had a body; but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but only <ref target="#ref_20188">bodiless as objects, not as agents</ref><note xml:id="ref_20188">bodiless as objects, not as agents.: In this complicated speech, Ahab seems to argue that if the wind had a body, a visible presence, he could strike it. But he abandons this fancy to consider worse things than the wind. In doing so, he recurs to the philosophical distinction between principle (concept) and agent (manifestation of concept) he has made before, but here with a slight change in wording. In this case, agents are the material manifestations (that is, bodies) of objects, which are bodiless (conceptual like Platonic “forms” that are objective in the sense that they are the fundamental reality). In stressing his idea of the malicious difference between principle and agent, Ahab reminds us of earlier speeches concerning Moby Dick that draw upon the same distinction. See, for instance, Ahab’s “be the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak [my] hate upon him” (Ch. 36), and “All that most maddens and torments . . . were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby Dick” (Ch. 41). See also "Platonian Leviathan" in Ch. 55.</note>. There’s a most special, a most cunning, oh, a most malicious difference!

According to the OED, “swift” can mean “to go swiftly.” Thus, “swift and swerve” is a legitimate alliterating doublet (pairing of synonyms) that parallels “turn and tack” earlier in the text. But since the Mississippi is well known for its shifting banks, Melville may have revised the text to “shift.” Equally possible is that an editor or printer made the change, intentionally or inadvertently.

And by the eternal Poles! these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on; these Trades, or something like them—something so unchangeable, and full as strong, blow my keeled soul along!

But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea; there’s time for that. An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of Nantucket! The same!—the same!—the same to Noah as to me. There’s a soft shower to leeward. Such lovely leewardings! They must lead somewhere—to something else than common land, more palmy than the palms. Leeward! the white whale goes that way; look to windward, then; the better if the bitterer quarter. But good bye, good bye, old mast-head! What’s this?—green? aye, tiny mosses in these warped cracks. No such green weather stains on Ahab’s head! There’s the difference now between man’s old age and matter’s. But aye, old mast, we both grow old together; sound in our hulls, though, are we not, my ship? Aye, minus a leg, that’s all. By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way. I can’t compare with it; and I’ve known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers. What’s that he said? he should still go before me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But where? Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and all night I’ve been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to. Aye, aye, like many more thou told’st direful truth as touching thyself, O Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short. Good by, mast-head—keep a good eye upon the whale, the while I’m gone. We’ll talk to-morrow, nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and tail.”

It is a thing not <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1471323142725-2l2773jfz3u-89f1168568c9be30934c171871c8f1c7%2FMD_Amer_0663.jpg"/> uncommonly happening to the whale-boats in those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments in the east. But these were the first sharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first descried; and whether it was that Ahab’s crew were all such tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks—a matter sometimes well known to affect them,—however it was, they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Heart of wrought steel!” murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and following with his eyes the receding boat—“canst thou yet ring boldly to that sight?—lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and followed by them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third day?—For when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit; be sure the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the third the evening and the end of that thing—be that end what it may.

A low rumbling sound was heard; a subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise, but obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping back into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Give way!” cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to the attack; but maddened by yesterday’s fresh irons that corroded in him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by <ref target="#ref_18837">all the angels that fell from heaven</ref><note xml:id="ref_18837">all the angels that fell from heaven: The followers of Satan in his rebellion against God, listed in <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, Book 1.</note>.

Lashed round and round to the fish’s back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The harpoon dropped from his hand.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Befooled, befooled!”—drawing in a long lean breath—“Aye, Parsee! I see thee again.—Aye, and thou goest before; and this, this then is the hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last letter of thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship! those boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to me; if not, Ahab is enough to die—Down, men! the first thing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon. Ye are not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.—Where’s the whale? gone down again?”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the ship,—which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the present her headway had been stopped. He seemed swimming with his utmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Oh! Ahab,” cried Starbuck, “not too late is it, even now, the third day, to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that madly seekest him!”

And at last when Ahab was sliding by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck’s face as he leaned over the rail, he hailed <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1471323198888-zwxinfpr9vk-89f1168568c9be30934c171871c8f1c7%2FMD_Amer_0666.jpg"/> him to turn the vessel about, and follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards, he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in repairing them. One after the other, through the port-holes, as he sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just gained that perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to the mast.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Whether fagged by the three days’ running chase, and the resistance to his swimming in the <ref target="#ref_18827">knotted hamper</ref><note xml:id="ref_18827">knotted hamper: snarled ropes.</note> he bore; or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White Whale’s way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more; though indeed the whale’s last start had not been so long a one as before. And still as Ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at almost every dip.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. Pull on! ’tis the better rest, the shark’s jaw than the yielding water.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along with the White Whale’s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its advance—as the whale sometimes will—and Ahab was fairly within the smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale’s spout, curled round his great, <ref target="#ref_18838">Monadnock</ref><note xml:id="ref_18838">Monadnock: Dominant rocky dome in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, about which Emerson had published the poem "Monadnoc" in 1847.</note> hump; he was even thus close to him; when, with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea. As it was, three of the oarsmen—who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for its effects—these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a combing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man helplessly dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.

However, there is some logic to the change. Once harpooned, Moby Dick first writhes then immediately darts off; however, the lengthy description of the three sailors’ being bumped—important because the third is Ishmael who survives to tell the tale—intervenes between these two “almost simultaneous” events, and by the time the text reaches the second event, the simultaneity of the writhing and darting off might not on second thought have seemed relevant to Melville. One possibility, then, is that Melville intended to substitute “instantaneously” for “simultaneously” and delete what would then become a repetitive “instantaneous” at the end of the sentence; however, while the transposition was made, the deletion of “instantaneous” was not.
