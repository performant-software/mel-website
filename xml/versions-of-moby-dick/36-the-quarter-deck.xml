Chs. 37–39 are soliloquies, while Ch. 40 is a single-act setpiece staged on the forecastle and opening with a rising curtain (the foresail). Similarly, see the title of Ch. 29: “Enter Ahab; To Him, Stubb.”</note>

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">IT was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at that hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in the garden.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1512706396851-tfoqhu2u73n-71ddd8d8e10849fd6d74e0465ce936ac%2FMD_Amer_0214.jpg"/> mark of his walk. Did you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also, you would see still stranger foot-prints—the foot-prints of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“D’ye mark him, Flask?” whispered Stubb; “the chick that’s in him pecks the shell. T’will soon be out.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The hours wore on;—Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the deck, with the same intense <ref target="#ref_16529">bigotry of purpose</ref><note xml:id="ref_16529">bigotry of purpose: obstinate, selfish intent.</note> in his aspect.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Sir!” said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on ship-board except in some extraordinary case.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Send everybody aft,” repeated Ahab. “Mast-heads, there! come down!”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">When the entire ship’s company were assembled, and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew, started from his stand-point; and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1512706415924-2mjmogi3enl-71ddd8d8e10849fd6d74e0465ce936ac%2FMD_Amer_0215.jpg"/> witnessing a pedestrian feat. But this did not last long. Vehemently pausing, he cried:—

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Sing out for him!” was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of <ref target="#ref_16530">clubbed</ref><note xml:id="ref_16530">clubbed: joined. </note> voices.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Good!” cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“And what do ye next, men?”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Lower away, and after him!”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“And what tune is it ye pull to, men?”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly, almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:—

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white whale. Look ye! d’ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?”—holding up a broad bright coin to the sun—“it is <ref target="#MDch36Note1"><hi rend="bold">a sixteen dollar piece, men</hi></ref><note xml:id="MDch36Note1">REVISION NARRATIVE: a sixteen dollar piece, men. // The British version adds “—a doubloon” to give “a sixteen dollar piece, men,—a doubloon.” Chances are Melville made this revision to the copy of <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi> he sent to England. The word “doubloon” does not appear again until Ch. 99, “The Doubloon.” Presumably, Melville added the word here in Ch. 36 when Ahab first shows the $16 coin to provide a clear verbal link between it and Ch. 99. The editors of the NN <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi> add this revision to its text; however, in keeping with its principle of not mixing versions, MEL notes the revision here but does not make the change.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand, ex-<pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1512706434488-ak6c5md6fff-71ddd8d8e10849fd6d74e0465ce936ac%2FMD_Amer_0216.jpg"/>hibiting the gold with the other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: “Whosoever of ye <ref target="#ref_16531">raises</ref><note xml:id="ref_16531">raises: sees and shouts out for.</note> me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke—look ye, whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale, he shall have this <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:1117" type="artwork">gold ounce</name>, my boys!”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Huzza! huzza!” cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“It’s a white whale, I say,” resumed Ahab, as he threw down the top-maul; “a white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for <ref target="#ref_16532">white water</ref><note xml:id="ref_16532">white water: foam created when a whale falls back into the sea after flinging itself out of the water (“breaching”).</note>; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Captain Ahab,” said Tashtego, “that white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Moby Dick?” shouted Ahab. “Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?” said the Gay-Header deliberately.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“And has he a curious spout, too,” said Daggoo, “very bushy, even for a <ref target="#ref_16533">parmacetty</ref><note xml:id="ref_16533">parmacetty: slang for spermaceti or sperm whale.</note>, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“And he have one, two, tree—oh! good many iron in him hide, too, Captain,” cried Queequeg disjointedly, “all twiske-tee be-twisk, like him—him—” faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottle—“like him—him—”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Corkscrew!” cried Ahab, “aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual sheep-shearing; aye, <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1512706456524-vigeuxjlya-71ddd8d8e10849fd6d74e0465ce936ac%2FMD_Amer_0217.jpg"/> Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a <ref target="#ref_16534">split jib in a squall</ref><note xml:id="ref_16534">split jib in a squall: ripped triangular headsail in a storm.</note>.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Captain Ahab,” said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. “Captain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick—but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg?”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Who told thee that?” cried Ahab; then pausing, “Aye, Starbuck; aye, my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Vengeance on a dumb brute!” cried Starbuck, “that simply smote thee from blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing, Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous.”

Pasteboard (papier-mâché) is the common material of the masks of Egyptian mummies. As a possible source for “pasteboard mask,” Mansfield and Vincent suggest <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi>’s “Pasteboard Visor” (1.1.1) and the same book’s “Paste-board-Nose” (2.3.15). In his review essay “Hawthorne and His Mosses,” Melville writes: “Tormented into desperation, Lear, the frantic king, tears off the mask, and speaks the sane madness of vital truth.” In <hi rend="italic">Pierre</hi>, Pierre vows to strike through the mask of the unknown.</note> But in each event—in the living act, the undoubted deed—there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man will strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there’s naught beyond. But ’tis enough. He tasks me; he <ref target="#ref_16541">heaps</ref><note xml:id="ref_16541">heaps: imposes on (Melville’s invention).</note> me; I see in him outrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it.

Talk not to me of blasphemy, man; I’d strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the sun do that, then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my master, man, is even that fair play. Who’s over me? Truth hath no confines. Take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends’ glarings is a doltish stare! So, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow.

For again Starbuck’s downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the winds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as before. Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come? But rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so much predictions from without, as verifications of the foregoing things within. For with little external to constrain us, the innermost necessities in our being, these still drive us on.

In the image, Ahab contains an “interior volition,” which, like the static built up in a Leyden jar, he wants to transmit, like an electric shock, into the crew, thus animating them with his will. In “Hawthorne and His Mosses” (the review essay written during the composition of <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi>), Melville uses a similar version of the same electric image to describe Hawthorne’s genius, which administers a “shock of recognition” to the rest of the world. Thus, the locution “shocked into them” carries for Melville its own specialized meaning. However, the British edition changes the phrasing of “shocked into them” to “shocked them into,” and thereby inverts the electric image. Here, Ahab would provide a shock so that the crew, with a volition of its own, would then become as fiery as Ahab. The revision is probably editorial and perhaps accidental.

Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do appoint ye three cup-bearers to my three pagan kinsmen there—yon three most honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers.
