</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">HAD you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom, and bringing out a large <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1512707493150-vi1lqsrcuu-b9d30a5c467feb75d727b41b12c2effe%2FMD_Amer_0256.jpg"/>wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating himself before it, you would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank. At intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein were set down the seasons and places in which, on various former voyages of various ships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and others were substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans, it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the <ref target="#ref_16800">unhooped</ref><note xml:id="ref_16800">unhooped: Uncontained, by analogy to the hoops on barrels.</note> oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby calculating the driftings of the <ref target="#ref_16801">sperm whale’s food</ref><note xml:id="ref_16801">sperm whale’s food: large deep-water squid.</note>; and, also, calling to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey.

On this hint, attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct—say, rather, secret intelligence from the Deity—mostly swim in <hi rend="italic">veins</hi>, as they are called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with one <ref target="#ref_16802">tithe</ref><note xml:id="ref_16802">tithe: typically a ten-percent religious tax or pledge, but here simply one-tenth.</note> of such marvellous precision.

* [Melville's Note] Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by an official circular, issued by <ref target="#ref_17051">Lieutenant Maury</ref><note xml:id="ref_17051">an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury: Oceanographer, and Director of the Naval Observatory <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:392">Matthew Fontaine Maury</ref> (1806-1873); the circular has not been found, but a version of its contents appears in Maury's 1854 <hi rend="italic">Explanations and Sailing Directions to Accompany the Wind and Current Charts</hi>.</note>, of the National Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and portions of it are presented in the circular. “This chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each of which districts are three lines; one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month in every district, and the two others to show the number of days in which whales, sperm or right, have been seen.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality, perhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true. In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what is called the <ref target="#ref_21335">Seychelle</ref><note xml:id="ref_21335">Seychelle ground: the whaling waters near the Seychelle Islands, northeast of Madagascar.</note> ground in the Indian ocean, or <ref target="#ref_16812">Volcano Bay</ref><note xml:id="ref_16812">Volcano Bay: Most likely Kagoshima Bay below Japan's still-active volcano, Mt. Sakurajima.</note> on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there. So, too, with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed himself. But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged abode. And where Ahab’s chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a particular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities would become probabilities, and, as Ahab <ref target="#ref_16804">fondly</ref><note xml:id="ref_16804">fondly: foolishly.</note> thought, <ref target="#MDch44Note1">every possibility the next thing to a certainty</ref><note xml:id="MDch44Note1">when all possibilities would become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every <hi rend="bold">possibility</hi> the next thing to a certainty.: The editors of the NN <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi> find a problem in the logic of these statements. As it stands in both the American and British editions, the idea is that, theoretically, when Ahab reaches a certain “set time or place,” the possibility of finding Moby Dick becomes a probability, and that, in Ahab’s mind, such a possibility is actually a certainty. In other words, Ahab "fondly," that is, foolishly redefines the notion of possibility to match his point of view. However, the NN editors argue that Melville intended a graduated, logical progression in the statements rather than a vaulting redefinition, and they revised the word “possibility” to “probability” so that in the first clause, possibilities become probabilities, and in the second (via Ahab’s mentality) “probability” becomes “the next thing to a certainty.” The NN version significantly alters meaning. Whereas  Melville’s original wording reveals an Ahab so certain of his chartings that he can make, in his mind, a near certainty out of mere possibility, the NN revision renders Ahab’s logical leap much smaller, from a probability to near certainty. Because there is no reason to think Melville’s original wording violates logic or requires correction, MEL makes no change.</note>. That particular set time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrase—the <ref target="#ref_16805">Season-on-the-Line</ref><note xml:id="ref_16805">Season-on-the-Line: the best time for whaling along the Equator (“the Line”) in the Pacific.</note>.

As the earth moves around the sun, the line-up of constellations also appears to move every night, so that over the course of a month one constellation rises along the zodiacal belt (visible in the night sky), and another sets (becoming invisible because of daylight). From this daytime perspective, it may be said, astronomically, that during each month the sun obscures a particular constellation, or, astrologically, that the sun inhabits the “house” of that constellation’s “sign,” or, in Ishmael’s terms, the sun “loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the Zodiac.” In Ch. 99, Stubb uses the zodiac in his reading of the doubloon.</note>. There it was, too, that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the waves were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.

Therefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season. Yet the premature hour of the Pequod’s sailing had, perhaps, been covertly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very complexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow off the <ref target="#ref_21338">Persian Gulf</ref><note xml:id="ref_21338">Persian Gulf: Also called the Arabian Gulf and accessed from the Indian Ocean, the Persian Gulf is a 615-mile long sea bordered by Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Quatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.</note>, or in the <ref target="#ref_21339">Bengal Bay</ref><note xml:id="ref_21339">Bengal Bay: The sea-like Bay of Bengal on the northern Indian Ocean is bordered by India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Indonesia.</note>, or China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race.

Later in the paragraph, with the sentence beginning “And here,” Ishmael returns to observe Ahab, but with his invocation beginning “Ah, God!” Ishmael provides an interior monologue of his own. Thus, in navigating through two minds, the narration shows Ishmael's affinity for Ahab's consciousness. But Ishmael’s "Yes" in answer to his own question, poses problems. The question asks whether trying to find “one solitary whale” in the ocean is madness. In the American and British editions, Ishmael answers “Yes.” However, the follow-up sentence, beginning with “For the peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick,” tells us that Moby Dick’s whiteness is “unmistakable,” implying that finding this particular whale is not madness. Either Melville intended to have Ishmael say “Yes! However . . .” or “No! For . . .” But neither he nor his British editor caught the inadequate “Yes. For . . .” combination. The NN edition changes “Yes” to “No”; but The Longman and MEL editions make no change.</note>. For the peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be unmistakable.

And here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength. Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms.

Yet these, perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1512707578030-sd2x5ajaidj-b9d30a5c467feb75d727b41b12c2effe%2FMD_Amer_0261.jpg"/>that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again. The latter was the eternal, living principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab’s case, yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its own.

The absurd image could not be more poorly placed, as it ruins the serious tone of Ahab’s desperate night terrors. The change is doubly unfortunate for, despite its unintended absurdity, the association with an unfledged or new-born bird still lacking flight feathers is plausible enough so that British readers might not recognize it as an error. Moreover, those finding it odd would not readily guess at the intended spelling, “unfathered birth,” which, among mammals, is unlikely.
