</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">FROM his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not compress him. By good rights he should only be treated of in <ref target="#ref_18441">imperial folio</ref><note xml:id="ref_18441">imperial folio: In bookmaking, a “folio” is the largest in size, made of single sheets of paper (typically 17 x 22 inches) that have been folded only once. Within this single-fold category, folios vary in size depending on the size of the paper sheets used. The "imperial" and “Elephant” folios use larger than standard size sheets and are the largest of the large. See Melville's previous play on book size and whale classification in Ch. 32.</note>. Not to tell over again his <ref target="#ref_20802">furlongs</ref><note xml:id="ref_20802">furlong: 1/8th of a US statute mile, or 220 yards.</note> from spiracle to tail, and the yards he measures about the waist; only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like great cables and hausers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a line-of-battle-ship.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behoves me to <ref target="#ref_18430">approve</ref><note xml:id="ref_18430">approve: prove.</note> myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not overlooking the minutest seminal <ref target="#ref_18431">germs</ref><note xml:id="ref_18431">germs: cells.</note> of his blood, and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels. Having already described him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it now remains to magnify him in an archæological, fossiliferous, and <ref target="#ref_18432">antediluvian</ref><note xml:id="ref_18432">antediluvian: before the biblical flood.</note> point of view. Applied to any other creature than the Leviathan—to an ant or a flea—such portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent. But when Leviathan is the text, the case is altered. Fain am I to stagger to this <ref target="#ref_20873">emprise</ref><note xml:id="ref_20873">Fain . . . emprise: eager to undertake the enterprise</note> under the weightiest words of the dictionary. And here be it said, that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations, I have invariably used a <ref target="#ref_18442">huge quarto <hi rend="bold">edition</hi> of Johnson</ref><note xml:id="ref_18442">REVISION NARRATIVE: huge quarto <hi rend="bold">edition</hi> of <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:350" type="person">Johnson</name> // After the single-fold folio (see “imperial folio,” above), the quarto is the second largest size of books: It consists of standard sheets of paper folded twice to give pages one-fourth the size of a single sheet. Although smaller than a folio, the quarto is still larger than the standard octavo. Samuel Johnson’s <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/text:211" type="text"><hi rend="italic">Dictionary of the English Language</hi></name> was originally published in folio format in 1755 but appeared in still-hefty quarto editions as early as 1808.

In the British version, “edition” has been deleted from Ishmael’s phrase “a huge quarto edition of Johnson” to give “a huge quarto of Johnson.” No doubt Melville requested the revision as it enhances Ishmael’s joke: Not only is Johnson’s large-format dictionary appropriate for the big words needed to describe Leviathan, but also the legendarily portly Johnson is a quarto of a man. See also Johnson in Chs. 53 and 69. To compare American and British pages, click the thumbnails in the right margin.</note>, <pb facs="/images/md-british-v3/MD_Brit_v3_0138.jpg"/> expressly purchased for that purpose; because that famous lexicographer’s uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject, though it may seem but an ordinary one. How, then, <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1518930771188-1jgtz32o2-d4fd436868cdc217008a4549a60a105b%2FMD_Amer_0544.jpg"/>with me, writing of this Leviathan? Unconsciously my <ref target="#ref_18434">chirography</ref><note xml:id="ref_18434">chirography: penmanship.</note> expands into placard capitals. Give me a condor’s quill! Give me <ref target="#ref_18443">Vesuvius’ crater</ref><note xml:id="ref_18443">condor's quill . . . Vesuvius’ crater: Stationed in the navy in Callao, the port of Lima, Peru, in 1843, Melville could have witnessed the Andean condor—a vulture with a wingspan of over 10 feet—in person. Images of <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:1093" type="artwork">Vesuvius</name>, the famous active volcano and crater looming above Naples, were published well before and throughout Melville’s day. According to Dennis Berthold, Vesuvius (which had recently erupted in 1850) was a metaphor of revolution as well as of size. As such, combined with the preceding South American “condor’s quill,” it signals Melville’s attention to worldwide revolutionary eruptions, repeatedly evoked elsewhere in <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi>. (See, for example, notes on "eternal democracy" in Ch. 24, on "sea-Parisians" in Ch. 54, and "Hydriote" in Ch. 96.)</note> for an inkstand! Friends, hold my arms! For in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth, and throughout the whole universe, not excluding its suburbs. Such, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and liberal theme! We expand to its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my credentials as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been a stone-mason, and also <ref target="#ref_20849">a great digger of ditches</ref><note xml:id="ref_20849">a great digger of ditches, canals . . . of all sorts: In 1839, after some study of engineering and surveying, Melville applied for employment on the Erie Canal improvement project. Despite support from a well-placed uncle, he failed, and instead went to sea for the first time, on a merchant vessel.</note>, canals and wells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by way of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate intercepted links, between the <ref target="#ref_18435">ante-chronical</ref><note xml:id="ref_18435">ante-chronical: before recorded time.</note> creatures, and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales hitherto discovered belong to the <ref target="#ref_20850">Tertiary period</ref><note xml:id="ref_20850">Tertiary period . . . superficial formations: In geology, the “Tertiary period” is 26 to 66 million years ago; the superficial formations were in Melville's day also called Quaternary. Chapter 104 shows Melville’s familiarity with geologic time, in terms used in both the <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/text:212"><hi rend="italic">Penny Cyclopaedia</hi></ref> article “Whales” and <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:365">Robert Chambers'</ref> <hi rend="italic">Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</hi> (1846). Melville also employs biblical time when useful, as in “pre-Adamite” in the following paragraph, “Adam’s time” in Ch. 105, and the supposed date of the Flood in “Epilogue.”</note>, which is the last preceding the superficial formations.  And though none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time, they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects, to justify their taking rank as Cetacean fossils.

Among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the <ref target="#ref_27555">Rue Dauphiné in Paris</ref><note xml:id="ref_27555">the Rue Dauphiné . . . Tuileries: The royal palace called the Tuilleries (destroyed in 1871) was far from the Rue Dauphine (no accent mark), across the Seine. Melville is referring to the Rue du Dauphin, but may have confused the name with the Dauphiné region of the French Alps.</note>, a short street opening almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon’s time. <ref target="#ref_27558">Cuvier</ref><note xml:id="ref_27558">Cuvier: <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:289">baron Georges Cuvier</ref>, the French zoologist, was at the forefront of comparative anatomy and paleontology.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the almost complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842, on the plantation of <ref target="#ref_27557">Judge Creagh</ref><note xml:id="ref_27557">Judge Creagh, in Alabama . . . fallen angels . . . Basilosaurus . . . Owen, the English Anatomist . . . Zeuglodon . . . of existence: Melville’s generally correct description is laced with minor inaccuracies. As early as the 1830s, plantation owners in Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana had unearthed fossil remains of what one Judge Jonathan Creagh took to be a sea monster. In 1835 (not 1842) Creagh sent the relics to Richard Harlan in Philadelphia, who mistakenly identified the “monster” as a prehistoric reptile, naming it Basilosaurus (regal lizard). Four years later, the eminent English paleontologist  <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:366">Sir Richard Owen</ref> determined that Basilosaurus was actually a mammalian relative of the whale, which he christened Zeuglodon (a term no longer applied). Creagh’s further discovery in 1842 of an almost complete set of fossilized remains fully substantiated the identity of the prehistoric whale. Soon after, amateur paleontologist and showman Albert Koch (discoverer of the mastodon called Missourium) displayed full skeletons throughout the United States and Europe. Melville may have seen his exhibits in Albany or New York City, or read an 1845 review of the spectacle in the New York Evangelist (the journal that later attacked <i>Typee</i>) proclaiming: “Perhaps when we touch his ribs, we are touching the residuum of some of Cain’s descendants that perished in the Deluge” (as quoted in Zimmer). Perhaps it is this absurd speculation of urban religionists that Melville, in his rendition, converts into the naïve wonderment of plantation slaves who think they have seen the remnants of fallen angels. (See also Mansfield and Vincent, 810; Vincent, 346.)</note>, in Alabama. The awe-stricken credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels. The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus. But some specimen bones of it being taken across the sea to <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:366" type="person">Owen</name>, the English Anatomist, it turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed species. A significant illustration of the fact, again and again repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body. So Owen rechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his paper read before the London Geological Society, pronounced it, in substance, one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted out of existence.

Melville echoes Denon in “great temple,” “ceiling,” and “plani-sphere.” Contrary to Ishmael’s belief expressed later in the paragraph, the temple postdates Solomon.</note>, some fifty years ago, there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins, and dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns. Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam as of yore; was there swimming in that planisphere, centuries before Solomon was cradled.
