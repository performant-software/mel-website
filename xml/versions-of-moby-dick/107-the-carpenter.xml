</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><hi rend="smallcaps">Seat</hi> thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary. But most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of the high, humane abstraction; the Pequod’s carpenter was no duplicate; hence, he now comes in person on this stage.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent, alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own; the carpenter’s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of the generic remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship, upon a three or four years’ voyage, in uncivilized and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in <ref target="#ref_22382">ordinary duties</ref><note xml:id="ref_22382">ordinary duties: The carpenter's "ordinary duties" listed below include repairing "sprung spars," which have been strained enough to injure their wooden fibers; fitting "bull’s eyes," which in this case are thick pieces of glass embedded in the deck to allow light below; and fashioning "tree-nails" (pronounced trunnels) or long wooden pegs used to fasten the ship’s planking to its timber skeleton.</note>:—repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull’s eyes in the deck, or new tree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both useful and <ref target="#ref_18504">capricious</ref><note xml:id="ref_18504">capricious: responsive to others’ whims.</note>.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold, was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices, of different sizes, and both of iron <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1518933300976-8fbekcurcup-c6b2da74e9fa974f9307b1b5f31a3dab%2FMD_Amer_0556.jpg"/> and of wood. At all times except when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed <ref target="#ref_18506">athwartships</ref><note xml:id="ref_18506">athwartships: sideways, crosswise. </note> against the rear of the Try-works.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">A <ref target="#ref_18508">belaying pin</ref><note xml:id="ref_18508"><name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:993" type="artwork">belaying pin</name>: large peg in various places on deck, to which ropes are secured.</note> is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole: the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and straightway files it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage strays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of right-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood, the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation. A sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter drills his ears. Another has the toothache: the carpenter out pincers, and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have him draw the tooth.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent and without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he deemed but <ref target="#ref_18511">top-blocks</ref><note xml:id="ref_18511">top-blocks: large block-and-pulley for raising and lowering a topmast.</note>; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished, and with such liveliness of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For nothing was this man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace, and ignores you, though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in him, involving, too, <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1518933306458-tqyj3hd26nn-c6b2da74e9fa974f9307b1b5f31a3dab%2FMD_Amer_0557.jpg"/> as it appeared, an all-ramifying heartlessness;—yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an old, crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah’s ark. Was it that this old carpenter had been a life-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a stript <ref target="#ref_18512">abstract</ref><note xml:id="ref_18512">abstract: epitome.</note>; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born babe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next. You might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal process. He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one, must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers. He was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful, <ref target="#ref_18514"><hi rend="italic">multum in parvo</hi>, Sheffield contrivances</ref><note xml:id="ref_18514">multum in parvo, Sheffield contrivances: an all-in-one knife (the Latin means “much in little”); Sheffield, England, was known for its cutlery.</note>, assuming the exterior—though a little swelled—of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted to use the carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open that part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him up by the legs, and there they were.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter, was, after all, no mere machine of an <ref target="#ref_18498">automaton</ref><note xml:id="ref_18498">automaton: A machine that appears to move on its own. The most widely-known automaton in Melville’s day was the chess-playing contraption known as “The Turk,” created in 1769 by Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen of Hungary. Purchased by Johann Maelzel, who toured the U.S. with it during the 1820s and 1830s, it concealed a person, and was exposed as a fraud by Edgar Allan Poe in his essay “Maelzel’s Chess-Player” (1836). Nevertheless, it attracted crowds until its demise in a Philadelphia fire in 1854. Melville also incorporated an automaton in the deadly clock mechanism featured in his 1856 story “The Bell-Tower.”</note>. <ref target="#MDch107Note1">If he <hi rend="bold">did not have</hi> a common soul in him</ref><note xml:id="MDch107Note1">REVISION NARRATIVE: If he <hi rend="bold">did not have</hi> a common soul in him // The change in the British edition to “If he <hi rend="bold">had not</hi> a common soul” makes the dependent clause parallel with the main clause, “he had a subtle something, . . .” and it eliminates the repetition of “did” later on. Chances are that Melville made the revision. To compare American and British pages, click the thumbnails in the right margin.</note>, <pb facs="/images/md-british-v3/MD_Brit_v3_0159.jpg"/> he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty.

But there it was; and there it had abided for <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1518933323563-y4g6zydlxts-c6b2da74e9fa974f9307b1b5f31a3dab%2FMD_Amer_0558.jpg"/> now some sixty years or more. And this it was, this same unaccountable, cunning life-principle in him; this it was, that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing; but only like an unreasoning wheel, which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his body was a sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there, and talking all the time to keep himself awake.</p></div></body>
