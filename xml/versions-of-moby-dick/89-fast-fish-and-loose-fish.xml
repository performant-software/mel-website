</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> allusion to the waifs and waif-poles in the last chapter but one, necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company, a whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed and captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature. For example,—after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale, the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line. Thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal, undisputed law applicable to all cases.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment, was that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in A.D. 1695. But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law, yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter. They have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses <ref target="#ref_18153">Justinian’s Pandects</ref><note xml:id="ref_18153">Justinian’s Pandects: The Roman emperor Justinian (483–565) was responsible for this 50-volume digest of Roman law that resolved previous legal contradictions.</note> and the By-laws of the Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other People’s Business.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">II. A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">First: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast, when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupants,—a mast, an oar, a nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the same. Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any other recognised symbol of possession; so long as the party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well as their intention so to do.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks—the <ref target="#ref_18155">Coke-upon-Littleton</ref><note xml:id="ref_18155">Coke-upon-Littleton: Common title for Sir Edward Coke’s (pronounced cooks) commentaries (1628–44) on Sir Thomas Littleton’s authoritative fifteenth-century treatise on property law.</note> of the fist. True, among the more upright and honorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party. But others are by no means so scrupulous.

The sentence beginning here and the two that follow are somewhat tortuous in syntax, and either Melville, an editor, or both could have made the half a dozen changes in wording and punctuation that appear in the British edition. The revisions in the first sentence compress the subject/verb structure and reduce verbiage. However, an excessive use of colons, semi-colons, and dashes in the changes to the second two sentences augment the tortuousness of the passage, as if to mimic the kind of legalese one might associate with court documents. In the British version that follows, we have bolded the variants from the American version:

Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated in England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the <hi rend="bold">northern</hi> seas<hi rend="bold">, […]</hi> they (the plaintiffs) had succeeded in harpooning the fish; <hi rend="bold">but</hi> at last, through peril of their lives, <hi rend="bold">were obliged</hi> to <hi rend="bold">forsake,</hi> not only their lines, but their boat itself<hi rend="bold">,—Furthermore: ultimately</hi> the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up with the <hi rend="bold">whale;</hi> struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs<hi rend="bold">;—Yet again:—and</hi> when those defendants were remonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs’ teeth, . . .

Scholarly editorial teams disagree—even with themselves—over the editing of this passage, contributing significantly to its textual fluidity. The editors of the first Norton Critical Edition of <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi> (NCE 1967)—Harrison Hayford and Hershel Parker—added all of the British changes in their version of this passage. However, twenty years later, the same editors had a change of mind when, along with G. Thomas Tanselle, they constructed their 1988 NN Edition of <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi>. Although they argued that Melville’s tortuous passage is “confused in its syntax” and “cannot be allowed to stand unchanged,” they nevertheless adopted only a selection of the British revisions (888). They accepted the British version of the first sentence as a “skillful revision” but rejected the other more recondite revisions of the second two sentences, assuming them to be the “‘pedantic’ alterations” of Melville’s British editor. They do not entertain the likelihood that Melville revised his own text in order to make it sound purposefully pedantic. Not surprisingly, the 2002 second edition of the NCE <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi> adopted the NN edition’s questionable mixing of versions for the three sentences, so that in conforming to the NN text it drifted from the all-British wording of the sentences in the earlier 1967 text. However, in another twist, the “revised third” NCE <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi> (2018), edited by Parker alone, reverted to the full British version found in the first NCE of 1967 (411, 416). Given our principle of not mixing versions but addressing alterations to Melville’s text in revision narratives, MEL makes no change to its first American edition copy text.

In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent <ref target="#ref_18151">crim. con.</ref><note xml:id="ref_18151">crim. con.: “criminal conversation,” legalese for adultery.</note> case, wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife’s viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to recover possession of her. <ref target="#MDch89Note3"><hi rend="bold">Erskine was on the other side; and he then supported it by saying</hi></ref><note xml:id="MDch89Note3">REVISION NARRATIVE: <hi rend="bold">Erskine was on the other side; and he then supported it by saying</hi> // Melville drew the details of the “loose-fish” whaling case, in which British barrister Thomas Erskine represented the defense, from an appendix to vol. 2 of William Scoresby's <hi rend="italic">An Account of the Arctic Regions</hi>; see Mansfield and Vincent (791–92). Scoresby's description also compares the whaling case to the civil case in which a husband filed claims against his estranged wife. Since the context makes clear that “the witty Erskine” had also represented the estranged wife, Melville or an editor dropped the superfluous first clause in the highlighted sentence—"Erskine was on the other side"—and revised the second to simply “He then proceeded to say.” Although the 1988 NN and 2002 second Norton editions concur with the American version and do not emend this passage, Hershel Parker—in his “revised third” Norton Critical Edition of <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi>—follows the British version by removing the redundant “Erskine was on the other side.” Since the redundancy does not cause serious confusion, MEL makes no change but notes here Melville’s likely removal of it.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very learned judge in set terms decided, to wit,—That as for the boat, he awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale, harpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish) acquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took the fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs.
