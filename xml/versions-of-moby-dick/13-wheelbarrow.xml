</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><hi rend="smallcaps">Next</hi> morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber, for a <ref target="#ref_16067">block</ref><note xml:id="ref_16067">block: a stand for displaying a wig.</note>, I settled my own and comrade’s bill; using, however, my comrade’s money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517782339328-f72e1wrxch-ea79a2d5e06f1b34dcd08b1e70fa38ee%2FMD_Amer_0101.jpg"/> friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequeg—especially as Peter Coffin’s cock and bull <ref target="#ref_27139"><hi rend="bold">stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom I now companied with.</hi></ref><note xml:id="ref_27139">REVISION NARRATIVE:  Because Melville inscribed additions and corrections on the proof sheets he sent to England, some of the British revisions are likely to have been made at his request. Equally possible is that an editor made changes that Melville would have made himself or approved. One case in point is the rambling clause at the end of the first paragraph of Ch. 13, which seems to circle back on itself. Referring to Queequeg, the phrasing states that Peter Coffin’s cock and bull “stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom I now companied with.” Someone—either Melville or an editor—revised this to the equally clumsy “stories had previously alarmed me about him.”  To compare American and British pages, click the thumbnails in the right margin.</note> <pb facs="/images/md-british-v1/MD_Brit_v1_0109.jpg"/>

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg’s canvas sack and hammock, away we went down to “the Moss,” the little Nantucket packet <ref target="#ref_16070">schooner</ref><note xml:id="ref_16070">schooner: two-masted, fore-and-aft rigged vessel.</note> moored at the wharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so much—for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets,—but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:1045" type="artwork">harpoon</name> barbs. I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and whether all whaling ships did not <ref target="#ref_16071">find</ref><note xml:id="ref_16071">find: supply free of cost.</note> their own harpoons. To this, in substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmers’ meadows armed with their own scythes—though in no wise obliged to furnish them—even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the thing—though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow—Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it fast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. “Why,” said I, “Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would think. Didn’t the people laugh?”
<pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517782378254-id7maqpwunh-ea79a2d5e06f1b34dcd08b1e70fa38ee%2FMD_Amer_0102.jpg"/>
</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of <ref target="#MDch13Note2">Kokovoko</ref><note xml:id="MDch13Note2">Kokovoko: Queequeg's island first appears in Ch. 12, but in the American version is mentioned again here and later in this paragraoh as "Rokovoko," a printer's error corrected in the British edition. To avoid unnecessary confusion, the NN, Longman, and MEL editions also emend to "Kokovoko."

Now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at Kokovoko, and its commander—from all accounts, a very stately <ref target="#ref_16069">punctilious</ref><note xml:id="ref_16069">punctilious: strictly adhering to etiquette. </note> gentleman, at least for a sea captain—this commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg’s sister, a pretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride’s bamboo cottage, this Captain marches in, and being assigned the post of honor, placed himself over against the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg’s father. Grace being said,—for those people have their grace as well as we—though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts—Grace, I say, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking himself—being Captain of a ship—as having plain precedence over a mere island King, especially in the King’s own house—the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punch bowl;—taking it I suppose for a huge <ref target="#ref_16072">finger-glass</ref><note xml:id="ref_16072">finger-glass: small bowl for washing soiled fingers at a formal dinner.</note>. “Now,” said Queequeg, “what you tink now?—Didn’t our people laugh?”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner. Hoisting sail, it glided down the <ref target="#ref_16080">Acushnet river</ref><note xml:id="ref_16080">Acushnet river: the river flowing between the coastal port towns of New Bedford and Fairhaven, Massachusetts. The Wampanoag word Acushnet is also a placename for part of the town of Fairhaven. On January 3, 1841, Melville sailed out of Fairhaven on the maiden voyage of the whaleship Acushnet.</note>. On one side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees all glittering in the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517782418552-zoojwxk45oq-ea79a2d5e06f1b34dcd08b1e70fa38ee%2FMD_Amer_0103.jpg"/> wharves, and side by side the world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises were on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his snortings. How I snuffed that <ref target="#ref_16073">Tartar</ref><note xml:id="ref_16073">Tartar: wild (from the nomadic Tartars, or Tartary, a region in Siberia).</note> air!—how I spurned that turnpike earth!—that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me. His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed teeth. On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan. Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian <ref target="#ref_16074">canes</ref><note xml:id="ref_16074">canes: bamboo-like grasses of India.</note> in land tornadoes. So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a <ref target="#ref_16075">lubber-like</ref><note xml:id="ref_16075">lubber-like: nautically ignorant (from land-lover).</note> assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back. I thought the bumpkin’s hour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517782443908-q3izxq71a8-ea79a2d5e06f1b34dcd08b1e70fa38ee%2FMD_Amer_0104.jpg"/> air; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Capting! Capting!” yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer; “Capting, Capting, here’s the devil.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Hallo, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> sir,” cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking up to Queequeg, “what in thunder do you mean by that? Don’t you know you might have killed that chap?”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“What him say?” said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“He say,” said I, “that you came near kill-e that man there,” pointing to the still shivering greenhorn.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Kill-e,” cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain, “ah! <ref target="#MDch13Note1">him bevy small-e fish-e</ref><note xml:id="MDch13Note1">him <hi rend="bold">bevy</hi> small-e fish-e: Queequeg’s “bevy” is dialect for “very.” The editors of the NN <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi> take “bevy” to be a typo and emends the word to “bery.” MEL makes no change.</note>; Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Look you,” roared the Captain, “I’ll kill-e <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, you cannibal, if you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to mind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted the <ref target="#ref_16076">weather-sheet</ref><note xml:id="ref_16076">weather-sheet: rope controlling the boom on the side from which the wind is blowing.</note>, and the tremendous <ref target="#ref_16077">boom</ref><note xml:id="ref_16077">boom: heavy pole extending horizontally from the mast along the foot of the mainsail.</note> was now flying from side to side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the midst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517782516680-a68hjrfejas-ea79a2d5e06f1b34dcd08b1e70fa38ee%2FMD_Amer_0105.jpg"/> under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was run into the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I looked at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone down. Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg now took an instant’s glance around him, and seeming to see just how matters were, dived down and disappeared. A few minutes more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked them up. The poor bumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump; the captain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Was there ever such <ref target="#ref_16078">unconsciousness</ref><note xml:id="ref_16078">unconsciousness: unself-consciousness.</note>? He did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He only asked for water—fresh water—something to wipe the brine off; that done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to himself—“It’s a mutual, <ref target="#ref_16079">joint-stock</ref><note xml:id="ref_16079">joint-stock: owned by stockholders.</note> world, in all meridians. We cannibals must help these Christians.”</p></div></body>
