THE PACIFIC

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">WHEN gliding by the <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:413" type="place">Bashee isles</name> we emerged at last upon the great <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:421" type="place">South Sea</name>; were it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear Pacific with uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my youth was answered; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">There is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath; like those fabled undulations of the <ref target="#ref_22370">Ephesian sod</ref><note xml:id="ref_22370">fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St. John: Bayle, <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:250">Hawthorne, Nathaniel, 1804-1864</ref>, and <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:364">Southey, Robert, 1774-1843</ref> all report a fable told by St. Augustine, about Ephesus, a Greek city in Turkey, where the ground moved over the grave of St. John the Evangelist because, though buried, he was not dead.

And meet it is, that over these sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery prairies and <ref target="#ref_18558">Potters’ Fields</ref><note xml:id="ref_18558">Potters’ Fields: Public burial grounds for paupers, unknown persons, and criminals. As told in Matthew 27.5–7, the original such field, owned by a potter, was bought for that purpose by the Jewish chief priests with the thirty pieces of silver Judas returned to them after repenting his betrayal of Jesus.

Compare “child-magian” in Ch. 79.</note> rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld, must ever after be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the midmost waters of the world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. The same waves wash the moles of the new-built Californian towns, but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men, and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than <ref target="#ref_18555">Abraham</ref><note xml:id="ref_18555">Abraham: The first Jewish patriarch (Genesis 11–50), with whose life the Judeo-Christian era begins.</note>; while all between float milky-ways of coral isles, and low-lying, endless, unknown Archipelagoes, and <ref target="#ref_18554">impenetrable Japans</ref><note xml:id="ref_18554">impenetrable Japans: By its own laws, Japan was closed to virtually all foreigners until U.S. Commodore Matthew Perry forced a limited opening in 1854.</note>. Thus this mysterious, divine Pacific zones the world’s whole bulk about; makes all coasts one bay to it; seems the tide-beating heart of earth. Lifted by those eternal swells, you needs must own the seductive god, bowing your head to <ref target="#ref_18552">Pan</ref><note xml:id="ref_18552">Pan: Greek god normally associated with fertility, but here also related to the oneness of God and nature, coincidentally called pantheism.

Launched at length upon these almost final waters, and gliding towards the Japanese cruising-ground, the old man’s purpose intensified itself. His firm lips met like the lips of a vice; the Delta of his forehead’s veins swelled like overladen brooks; in his very sleep, his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull, “Stern all! the White Whale spouts thick blood!”
