</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">SO far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed, as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in its earlier part, is as important a one as will be <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1512707684233-htl3ztmopo-5fae75ba9056d5edf7c0ab477933e441%2FMD_Amer_0262.jpg"/> found in this volume; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood, and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from these citations, I take it—the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by the same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same private cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose. This man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the other. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so fell out <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1512707701315-zj3h7ncufim-5fae75ba9056d5edf7c0ab477933e441%2FMD_Amer_0263.jpg"/> that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the last time distinctly recognized a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale’s eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are three instances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about <ref target="#ref_16828">Rinaldo Rinaldini</ref><note xml:id="ref_16828">Rinaldo Rinaldini: A violent knight in Italian chivalric poems, particularly Ludovico Ariosto's <hi rend="italic">Orlando Furioso</hi> (revised ed. 1532) and Torquato Tasso’s <hi rend="italic">Rinaldo</hi> (1562).

In attesting to the fame and celebrity of individual whales (like the fictional Moby Dick), Melville invites readers to enjoy the oddity of their names, but a “mix-up” seems to have occurred in the first American edition (NN <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi> 867), which gives these whale names as “Timor Tom … New Zealand Jack … and New Zealand Tom.” Apparently, an editor saw a problem with “New Zealand Tom,” and the first British edition "corrects" it to “New Zealand Jack.” But the correction was misguided. Actually, the first two names are the problem, for two of Melville’s whaling sources (Bennett’s <hi rend="italic">Narrative</hi> and Beale’s <hi rend="italic">Natural History</hi>) give the proper historical names as “Timor Jack” and “New Zealand Tom.” In fact, Melville underlined “Timor Jack” in his copy of Beale, indicating his awareness of the actual name. One possible scenario concerning the mix-up in the American text involves a compounding of errors: In writing “The Affidavit,” Melville inscribed the whale names from memory, confusing the first two but getting “New Zealand Tom” right, and neglected the inconsistency. The British “correction” of the correct New Zealand “Tom” to the erroneous New Zealand “Jack” only compounded the confusion. In their scholarly edition, the NN editors intervened to bring Melville’s misremembered names into conformity with his whaling sources, emending the first two names to the historically accurate “Timor Jack” and “New Zealand Tom.” Recognizing that the inconsistency in the American edition might unnecessarily confuse readers, Longman and MEL also emend to “Timor Jack” and “New Zealand Tom.” To compare American and British pages, click the thumbnails in the right margin.</note> <pb facs="/images/md-british-v2/MD_Brit_v2_0028.jpg"/> and Don Miguel, after at various times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed by valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with that express object as much in view, as in setting out through the Narragansett Woods, Captain <ref target="#ref_21345">Butler</ref><note xml:id="ref_21345">Captain Butler . . .

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that without some hints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the fishery, they might <ref target="#ref_16824">scout</ref><note xml:id="ref_16824">scout: scoff.</note> at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still worse and more detestable, a <ref target="#ref_21346">hideous and intolerable allegory</ref><note xml:id="ref_21346">a hideous and intolerable allegory: Having registered the white whale’s mythic features in Ch. 41 and essayed the fluid symbolism of its whiteness in Ch. 42, Ishmael here worries that readers will lose sight of the white whale as a living fact and take Moby Dick to be fictional, or more specifically a fable or allegory, which if poorly executed might reduce the whale to an "intolerable" set of fixed meanings. Melville probably added Ch. 45, or this section of it which underscores the “reasonableness” of the book’s “catastrophe” (i.e., the whale’s sinking of the ship), as he was nearing the end of the compositional process.</note>.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid conception of those perils, and the frequency with <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1512707737453-gw4ov5u8ev-5fae75ba9056d5edf7c0ab477933e441%2FMD_Amer_0265.jpg"/> which they recur. One reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at home, however transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you suppose that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by the whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan—do you suppose that that poor fellow’s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, <ref target="#MDch45Note1">among many others,</ref><note xml:id="MDch45Note1">among many <hi rend="bold">others,</hi> we spoke about thirty different ships: The American and British editions do not include a comma after "others"; and its absence is confusing. Without this comma, “among many others” must refer to “thirty different ships,” with the implication that these thirty are only a fraction of the many ships Ishmael met (or “spoke”). In turn, the lack of punctuation would mean that the total number of men reported killed came only from the thirty ships and that many other ships reported no deaths. This reduced death rate would undercut, if not contradict, the conclusion that there is at least one drop of human blood in each gallon of whale oil. However, with the  comma included, “among many others” refers to the voyages Ishmael has made in his life, and the implication is that on this one particular voyage, he met thirty ships, each one of which reported at least one death, a fact that substantiates Ishmael’s claim concerning blood and whale oil. The NN edition adds the second comma, as does MEL.</note> we <ref target="#ref_16825">spoke</ref><note xml:id="ref_16825">spoke: to “speak” a ship at sea is to communicate with it, often with the use of signal flags.</note> thirty different ships, every one of which had had a death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that had each lost a boat’s crew. For God’s sake, be economical with your lamps and candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man’s blood was spilled for it.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that when narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness, they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness; when, I declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of being facetious than <ref target="#ref_21348">Moses</ref><note xml:id="ref_21348">Moses, . . . the plagues of Egypt: Moses, traditional author of the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, relates the seven plagues of Egypt in Exodus 7–12.</note>, when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon testimony entirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy, and sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale <hi rend="italic">has</hi> done it.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">First: In the year 1820 <ref target="#MDch45Note">the ship Essex</ref><note xml:id="MDch45Note">the ship Essex . . . I have conversed with his son: Ishmael’s story of the Essex and of Captain George Pollard’s later history is factual. In addition, in August 1841, while whaling in the Pacific, Melville met Owen Chase’s son William, who loaned him a copy of his father’s narrative, which Melville read and returned. In April 1851, Melville’s father-in-law gave him a copy of Chase’s narrative as he was completing <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi>, and, probably that spring or summer, he added to Ch. 45 the footnoted excerpts from Chase’s “plain and faithful narrative." In fly leaves added to this copy of the narrative (and reproduced in the NN edition), Melville inscribed notes apparently in preparation for a prose work on the Essex that he never composed. In one note, titled “What I know of Owen Chace,” he claims (as does Ishmael) to have "seen" Owen Chace at sea; however, Melville was mistaken because during his whaling years Chase had already retired from the fleet. Melville did meet the Essex’s retired Captain Pollard on Nantucket in 1852, a year after the publication of <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi>. Pollard is featured as a haunted shell of a man in "A Sketch" in <hi rend="italic">Clarel</hi> (Book 1, canto 37). See Bryant, <hi rend="italic">Herman Melville: A Half Known Life</hi>, vol. 2, ch. 72.</note>, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket, was cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her boats, and gave chase to a shoal of <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1512707755403-1vjl4dyz0kz-5fae75ba9056d5edf7c0ab477933e441%2FMD_Amer_0266.jpg"/> sperm whales. Ere long, several of the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the ship. Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that in less than “ten minutes” she settled down and fell over. Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since. After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the land in their boats. Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since. At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket. I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy; I have read his plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed with his son; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe.*

* [Melville's Note] The following are extracts from Chace’s narrative: “Every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at a short interval between them, both of which, according to their direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock; to effect which, the exact manœuvres which he made were necessary. His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury. He came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered, and in which we had struck three of his companions, as if fired with revenge for their sufferings.” Again: “At all events, the whole circumstances taken together, all happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the time, impressions in my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many of which impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my opinion.”

Conversation turning upon whales, the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily denied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very good; but there is more coming. Some weeks after, the commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments’ confidential business with him. That business consisted in fetching the Commodore’s craft such a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair. I am not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore’s interview with that whale as providential.

An uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship, which was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him. We were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water. The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity.

And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; * &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; * &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; * &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; * &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; *  &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;  The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks.

According to the NN editors, one such change—head <hi rend="bold">on</hi> a gun—“does not make sense” (869), and, assuming the word “on” to be a mistranscription of Wafer’s original word “over,” they emend their text in conformity with the Wafer source text to read “head <hi rend="bold">over</hi> a gun.” The point of the Wafer anecdote is that the force of the whale’s impact is so great that it knocks cannons out of their carriages and men out of their hammocks; in addition, the captain sleeping in his cabin directly over the guns situated below decks is also knocked out of his room. However, the change to “head on a gun” also makes sense. One possible reading is that the buccaneer captain is to be seen sleeping with a gun under his pillow; another is that the captain may have his head resting on a small cannon, often mounted in captains’ stern quarters. Whatever the scenario Melville might have intended, the change to "head <hi rend="bold">on</hi> a gun" heightens the drama of the anecdote and is not misleading; and since it may be Melville’s intended revision of his Wafer source, MEL makes no change.</note>, was thrown out of his cabin!” Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great mischief along the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long withstand all the lances <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1512707873315-376ystoosdy-5fae75ba9056d5edf7c0ab477933e441%2FMD_Amer_0270.jpg"/> hurled at him from its decks.

Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes. But I must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon—Verily there is <ref target="#ref_21359">nothing new under the sun</ref><note xml:id="ref_21359">nothing new under the sun: Paraphrase of Ecclesiastes 1.9: “and there is no new thing under the sun.”</note>.

As many know, he wrote the history of his own times, a work every way of uncommon value.

Of what precise species this sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am certain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious resort. But further investigations have recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that on the <ref target="#ref_21362">Barbary coast</ref><note xml:id="ref_21362">Barbary coast: Famously infested with pirates, the coastline stretched along the shores of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya.</note>, a <ref target="#MDch45Note4"><hi rend="bold">Commodore Davis</hi></ref><note xml:id="MDch45Note4"><hi rend="bold">Commodore Davis</hi>: Melville’s “good authority” is the article on “Whale” in John Kitto’s 1845 <hi rend="italic">Cyclopaedia of Biblical Literature</hi>; however, the officer mentioned in that source is “<hi rend="bold">Commander Davies</hi>.” The NN edition revises "Commodore Davis" to “Commander Davies.” In keeping with its practice of not correcting Melville’s errors of fact, MEL makes no change.</note> of the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of war readily passes through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route, pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance called <ref target="#ref_16827"><hi rend="italic">brit</hi></ref><note xml:id="ref_16827">brit: tiny, floating crustaceans; see Ch. 58.</note> is to be found, the aliment of the right whale. But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale—squid or cuttle-fish—lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been found at its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to all human reasoning, Procopius’s sea-monster, that for half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a sperm whale.</p>
