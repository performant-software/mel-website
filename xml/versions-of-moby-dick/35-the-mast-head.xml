For though their progenitors, the builders of <ref target="#ref_20661">Babel</ref><note xml:id="ref_20661">Babel: The Tower of Babel in Genesis 11.1—and traditionally placed in what is present-day Iraq—was intended to reach heaven but was brought down by God.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which <ref target="#MDch35Note8">Obed Macy</ref><note xml:id="MDch35Note8">Obed Macy: Author of <hi rend="italic">The History of Nantucket</hi> (Boston: Hilliard, Gray, 1835). See also Extracts.</note>, the sole historian of Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us, that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the <ref target="#ref_16513">Bay whalemen of New Zealand</ref><note xml:id="ref_16513">Bay whalemen of New Zealand: New Zealand had several bay-whaling stations, where whales killed close to shore were processed.</note>, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other every two hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant—the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous <ref target="#ref_16514">Colossus at old Rhodes</ref><note xml:id="ref_16514">Colossus at old Rhodes: huge bronze statue of the sun god Helios, the legs of which allegedly spanned the harbor entrance on the Greek island of Rhodes.</note>. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no <ref target="#ref_16498">gazettes; extras</ref><note xml:id="ref_16498">gazettes; extras: newspapers; special editions providing late-breaking news.</note> with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner—for all your meals <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1471131412017-8y0fq9bofqi-8c061a7430d20b89267315e25dd2a982%2FMD_Amer_0209.jpg"/> for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In one of those southern whalemen, on a long three or four years’ voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your most usual point of perch is the head of the <ref target="#ref_22390">t’ gallant-mast</ref><note xml:id="ref_22390">t’ gallant-mast . . . t’ gallant cross-trees: third section of the mast; cross-trees: light, horizontal timbers.</note>, where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t’ gallant cross-trees.

You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of your watch-coat.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits, called <hi rend="italic">crow’s-nests</hi>, in which the look-outs of a Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas.

He called it the <hi rend="italic">Sleet’s crow’s-nest</hi>, in honor of himself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children after our own names (we fathers being the original inventors and patentees), so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget. In shape, the Sleet’s crow’s-nest is something like a large <ref target="#ref_16500">tierce or pipe</ref><note xml:id="ref_16500">tierce or pipe: 40- and 120-gallon wine casks, respectively.</note>; it is open above, however, where it is furnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or side next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this crow’s nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the little detailed conveniences of his crow’s-nest; but though he so enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this crow’s-nest, with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counter-acting the errors resulting from what is called the “local attraction” of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship’s planks, and in the Glacier’s <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1471131443335-b0xx7bkmafa-8c061a7430d20b89267315e25dd2a982%2FMD_Amer_0211.jpg"/> case, perhaps, to there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his learned <ref target="#ref_16501">“binnacle deviations,” “azimuth compass observations,” and “approximate errors,”</ref><note xml:id="ref_16501">“binnacle deviations,” . . . “approximate errors,”: problems and complex methods of correction related to compass inaccuracies.</note> he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little <ref target="#ref_16502">case-bottle</ref><note xml:id="ref_16502">case-bottle: small, square flask.</note>, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow’s nest, within easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird’s nest within three or four <ref target="#ref_16503">perches of the pole</ref><note xml:id="ref_16503">perches of the pole: a perch (also called a pole) is 5.5 yards, but perches are also birds’ resting places; hence a triple pun.</note>.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain Sleet and his Greenland-men were; yet that disadvantage is greatly counterbalanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we Southern fishers mostly float. For one, I used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there; then ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the <ref target="#ref_16504">top-sail yard</ref><note xml:id="ref_16504">top-sail yard: long, heavy pole, crossing the mast, from which the topsail is hung.</note>, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so at last mount to my ultimate destination.

With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how could I—being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering altitude,—how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale-ships’ standing orders, “Keep your <ref target="#ref_16505">weather eye open, and sing out</ref><note xml:id="ref_16505">weather eye open . . . sing out: be on guard; shout out.</note> every time.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient “interest” in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honorable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise. But all in vain; those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect; they are short-sighted; what use, then, to strain the visual nerve? They have left their opera-glasses at home.

Melville certainly erred in writing "Cranmer's," and his revision, probably in the revised copy of <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi> he sent to England, is an intended correction, although an editor might have noted the factual error and corrected it. An editor might have removed “Pantheistic” on vague religious grounds, but Melville would have reason to cut the word here as well. While Wycliffe’s ashes were spread everywhere, they are not therefore pantheistic (nor was Wycliffe a pantheist). Moreover, since Ishmael uses a version of the word in his last line—“Heed it well, ye Pantheists!”—Melville might also have cut the dubious reference regarding Wycliffe’s ashes so as not to undermine its more effective use in the chapter’s ending. Of these changes, the editors of the NN <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi>, adopted only one for their reading text. Assuming Melville intended to correct the name, they changed “Cranmer’s” to the British edition's spelling “Wickliff’s.” However, in keeping to its policy of not mixing versions, MEL makes no change but instead explains Melville’s strategies through revision annotation.
