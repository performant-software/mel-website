</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><hi rend="smallcaps">Besides</hi> her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly distinguished by her try-works. She presents the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship. It is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were transported to her planks.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The try-works are planted between the foremast and main-mast, the most roomy part of the deck. The timbers beneath <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1518929302787-ycqc1trg5n-1433a2f687eb34f8df1c4e4364b07ea6%2FMD_Amer_0506.jpg"/> are of a peculiar strength, fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar, some ten feet by eight square, and five in height. The foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the flanks it is cased with wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, <ref target="#ref_18302">battened</ref><note xml:id="ref_18302">battened: tightly covered.</note> hatchway. Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in number, and each of several barrels’ capacity. When not in use, they are kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand, till they shine within like silver punch-bowls. During the night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap. While employed in polishing them—one man in each pot, side by side—many confidential communications are carried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound mathematical meditation. It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies gliding along the <ref target="#ref_18298">cycloid</ref><note xml:id="ref_18298">cycloid: Melville is correct in this mathematical observation about a cycloid, which is a geometrical curve created by a point on the circumference of a circle that rolls in a straight line.</note>, my soapstone for example, will descend from any point in precisely the same time.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare masonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces, directly underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron. The intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works. By a tunnel inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as fast as it evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open direct from the rear wall. And here let us go back for a moment.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It was about nine o’clock at night that the Pequod’s try-works <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1518929307862-b46bj4yob5j-1433a2f687eb34f8df1c4e4364b07ea6%2FMD_Amer_0507.jpg"/> were first started on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee the business.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the works.” This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed for a time with wood. After that no wood is used, except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out, the crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still contains considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed the flames. Like <ref target="#ref_27600"><hi rend="bold">a plethoric burning martyr, or</hi></ref><note xml:id="ref_27600">REVISION NARRATIVE:
Burning Martyrs 1 //
The British edition made two expurgations in Melville’s seemingly innocuous explanation of how to fire up the try-works furnace. According to Ishmael, once the fire is started with wood, and once pieces of blubber have been rendered like crisp bacon, these remnant fritters are used to fuel the fire. Thus, the whale can be said to supply the fuel by which it is burned. But calling the whale in this condition “a plethoric burning martyr” verged on blasphemy and was cut, if not for the reference to victims such as Wycliffe and Cranmer (both burned at the stake for their religious views and mentioned in Ch. 35) then for the word “plethoric” (which means a superabundance of blood and implies a pathological excessiveness).

Would that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is horrible to inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you must live in it for the time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it, such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres. <ref target="#ref_27603"><hi rend="bold">It smells like the left wing of the day of judgment; it is an argument for the pit.</hi></ref><note xml:id="ref_27603">REVISION NARRATIVE: Burning Martyrs 2 // According to Matthew 25.41, on Judgment Day the condemned stand to God’s left; “Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.” Whaling writers often treated a night scene of trying-out as an image of the pit of hell, as if it were a scene from Dante’s <hi rend="italic">Inferno</hi>. J. Ross Browne’s description, in <hi rend="italic">Etchings of a Whaling Cruise</hi>, including the awful smell of the smoke, seems the image Melville had in mind. According to Mansfield and Vincent (797), Frederick Debell Bennett’s <hi rend="italic">Narrative of a Whaling Voyage</hi>, "A Chapter on Whaling" in H. H. Weld's <hi rend="italic">Ribs and Trucks</hi>, and the anonymous “The Whale and Whale Catching” also made the comparison. Despite these precedents, Melville's sentence was cut, probably not so much for its irreverence, as for its presumed crudeness in evoking the “unspeakable” smell of damnation and hell.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">By midnight the works were in full operation. <ref target="#MDch96Note1">We were clear from the <hi rend="bold">carcase</hi></ref><note xml:id="MDch96Note1">REVISION NARRATIVE: We were clear from the <hi rend="bold">carcase</hi> // According to the OED, “carcase” was a common alternate spelling of “carcass,” or the dead body, usually of an animal. In the British edition, “carcase” is changed to “case.” The word might be a typo, but the dropping of an entire syllable (car-) required to make such an error would be atypical of the other, smaller typos found in the British version. The word “case” is a likely but problematic revision: who performed it and why is not clear.
<lb/><lb/>In Ch. 77, Ishmael explains that the “case” (or what he calls the Great Heidelburgh Tun) of a whale is the top portion of the interior head that contains a vast well of liquid spermaceti. According to Thomas Beale’s <hi rend="italic">Natural History of the Sperm Whale</hi> (Melville’s primary whaling source in that chapter), the whale’s body is stripped first and then disposed of before the case (in the head hanging from the stern) is bailed and dropped, sinking immediately. However, Melville’s description of the butchering of the whale reverses Beale’s sequencing, making the stripping of the carcass follow the bailing of the case. Thus, here in Ch. 96, the American version’s description ends with the Pequod getting “clear from the carcase” and makes no mention of the disposal of the head. However, in the British version, the ship gets “clear from the case”; that is, its last act is to dispose of the head, and there is no mention of the stripped carcass. Neither American nor British reading adequately accounts for the full and actual whaling practice. It seems unlikely that an editor would have any reason to change “carcase” to “case,” but Melville would have been equally ill-advised to revise because the change to “case” contradicts the whaling process as he has described it.

But that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the <ref target="#ref_18296">famed Greek fire</ref><note xml:id="ref_18296">famed Greek fire: This petroleum-based substance, whose exact composition is still unknown, was introduced by the Byzantine Greeks in the seventh century.

The smoke rolled away in sullen heaps. To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces. Opposite the mouth of the works, on the further side of the wide wooden hearth, was the windlass. This served for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the watch, when not otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the fire, till their eyes felt scorched in their heads. Their tawny features, now all begrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted beards, and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works. As they narrated to each other their unholy adventures, their tales of terror told in words of mirth; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them, like the flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their front, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the ship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully champed the <ref target="#ref_18301">white <ref type="reference" target="glossary#bone_in_her_mouth"><w xml:id="bone_in_her_mouth">bone in her mouth</w></ref></ref><note xml:id="ref_18301">white bone in her mouth: foamy wave at the bow. </note>, and viciously spat round her on all sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden with fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that <ref target="#ref_18294">blackness of darkness</ref><note xml:id="ref_18294">blackness of darkness: From Jude 13, referring to the punishment of the wicked, and quoted in Ch. 2, “The Carpet-Bag.”</note>, seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander’s soul.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for that interval, in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness, the madness, the ghastliness of others. The continual sight of the fiend shapes before me, capering half in smoke and half in fire, these at last begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon as I began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable) thing occurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller smote my side, which leaned against it; in my ears was the low hum of sails, just beginning to shake in the wind; I thought my eyes were open; I was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart. But, spite of all this, I could see no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the <ref target="#ref_18300">card</ref><note xml:id="ref_18300">card: short for “compass card,” flat surface on which the directional points are marked.</note>, by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it. Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness. Uppermost was the impression, that whatever swift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came over me. Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is the matter with me? thought I. Lo! in my brief sleep I had turned myself about, and was fronting the ship’s stern, with my back to her prow and the compass. In an instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind, and very probably capsizing her. How glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night, and the fatal contingency of being <ref target="#ref_18293"><ref type="reference" target="glossary#brought_by_the_lee"><w xml:id="brought_by_the_lee">brought by the lee</w></ref></ref><note xml:id="ref_18293">brought by the lee: Unexpectedly turned so that the wind hits the lee side of the sails, a situation that might capsize the vessel.

Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first hint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its redness makes all things look ghastly.
