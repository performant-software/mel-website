</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds. Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his <ref target="#ref_19782">heraldic coat</ref><note xml:id="ref_19782">heraldic coat: striped, as in a coat of arms.</note> can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark.*

* [Melville's Note] With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness, it might be said, only arises from the circumstance, that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified terror.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the same quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish mass for the dead begins with “Requiem eternam” (eternal rest), whence <hi rend="italic">Requiem</hi> denominating the mass itself, and any other funereal music. Now, in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark, and the mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him <hi rend="italic">Requin</hi>. [Melville's note, concluded]

A goney, he replied. Goney! I never had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never!

And from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them.

Charles Stewart's <hi rend="italic">Visit to the South Seas</hi>, for his depiction of Lima. In addition to the city's earthquake ruins (see above), Stewart witnessed, in 1829, the skeletal remains of unburied casualties of Peru's recent revolutionary insurrections. Of the corpses, he wrote that the city center was "white with fragments of the human form." Stewart, who was his ship’s chaplain, was so struck with the horror of so many unburied bodies that he wrote that he could not preach to the ship’s crew the optimistic passage from Revelation 24: “And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death.” Though the scripture figures the end of death and tears, Stewart could feel no comfort in it after seeing Lima. Ishmael expresses some sense of Stewart’s despair when he calls Lima “the strangest, saddest city thou can’st see.” Given the “higher horror” it represents, Melville calls Lima “tearless,” not only meteorologically (see "tearlessness" above) but also ironically in reference to Stewart’s inability to preach the “wipe away all tears” passage in Revelation. See Bryant, <hi rend="italic">Melville: A Half Known Life</hi>, vo. 2, ch. 92; see also “The Town-Ho’s Story” (Ch. 54), which is set in Lima.</note>, the strangest, saddest city thou can’st see. For Lima has taken the white veil; and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe.

Much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness.

The original “in” suggests that the "instinct of the knowledge of demonism" is one of various features related to the world; whereas the revision to “of the world” suggests that this instinct of knowing is an inherent and pervasive quality that defines the world.

His “dim, random way” is, in fact, quite methodical; and in his final paragraph, he explains that the whale's whiteness instills fear because it symbolizes the “dumb blankness,” or nothingness, of the world. But the consequence of this metaphysical view is that given this nothingness, nature—with all its color—is itself not real, or worse, just so many “subtile deceits.” Ishmael’s intensity mounts as he reaches for the concluding line: “Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt?” But before he poses this question, his dismay at the physical world’s deceptiveness achieves its most forceful expression: “so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house within.” The British edition expurgates the line not only for its graphic images of a painted prostitute and a warehouse for dead bodies but also for its equating “deified Nature,” that is, God’s creation, with prostitution and death.
