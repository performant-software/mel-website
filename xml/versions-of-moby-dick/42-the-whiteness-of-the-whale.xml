<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he was to me, as yet remains unsaid.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which could not but occasionally awaken in any man’s soul some alarm, there was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form. It was the <ref target="#ref_21304">whiteness</ref><note xml:id="ref_21304">the whiteness of the whale: In their edition of <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/text:218">Moby-Dick</ref>, Luther S.

But how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I must, else all these chapters might be naught.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds. Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his <ref target="#ref_19782">heraldic coat</ref><note xml:id="ref_19782">heraldic coat: striped, as in a coat of arms.</note> can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark.*

* With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness, it might be said, only arises from the circumstance, that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified terror.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the same quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish mass for the dead begins with “Requiem eternam” (eternal rest), whence Requiem denominating the mass itself, and any other funereal music. Now, in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark, and the mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him Requin.

main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some king’s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its inexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God. As <ref target="#ref_19978">Abraham</ref><note xml:id="ref_19978"> As Abraham before the angels: That is, recognizing their otherworldliness (Genesis 18.2). See also Making Moby-Dick.</note> before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and turning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney! I never had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I learned that goney was some seaman’s name for albatross. So that by no possibility could Coleridge’s wild <ref target="#ref_21312">Rhyme</ref><note xml:id="ref_21312">Coleridge's wild Rhyme: <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/text:220">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</ref></note> have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to be an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this, that by a <ref target="#ref_21313">solecism</ref><note xml:id="ref_21313">solecism: grammatical mistake in speech or writing</note> of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses; and these I have frequently seen, but never with such emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl.

The flashing cascade of his mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god, <ref target="#ref_19818">bluff-bowed</ref><note xml:id="ref_19818">bluff-bowed: here, broad-chested.</note> and fearless as this mighty steed.

Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him with divineness; and that this divineness had that in it which, though commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and Albatross.

It is that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he bears. The Albino is as well made as other men—has no substantive deformity—and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this be so?

It cannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering there; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here. And from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in a milk-white fog—Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that even the king of terrors, when personified by the evangelist, rides on his <ref target="#ref_19984">pallid horse</ref><note xml:id="ref_19984">pallid horse: Revelation 6.8: “and I looked, and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was Death.” John the Evangelist (meaning gospel writer) is credited with the book of Revelation.</note>.

Let us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety, and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls.

According to Bryant, in researching for Moby-Dick, Melville revisited Charles Stewart's Visit to the South Seas, for its depiction of Lima. In addition to the city's earthquake ruins, Stewart witnessed, in 1829, the skeletal remains of unburied casualties of Peru's recent revolutionary insurrections. Of the corpses, he wrote that the city center was "white with fragments of the human form" (Melville: A Half Known Life, 1079-1083). "Tearless Lima" also reflects Melville's reading of Stewart's horror in the face of the city's dead.</note>, the strangest, saddest city thou can’st see.

One of the most crippling British expurgations to Moby-Dick occurs with the removal of this line from “The Whiteness of the Whale.” Ishmael calls the chapter an attempt to “explain myself,” and by essaying on “whiteness,” he hopes to get to the heart of what appalls him about the idea of Moby Dick. His “dim, random way” is, in fact, quite methodical; and in his final paragraph, he explains that whiteness instills fear because it symbolizes the “dumb blankness,” or nothingness, of the world. But the consequence of this deep, metaphysical view is that given this nothingness, nature—with all its color—is itself not real, or worse, just so many “subtile deceits.” Ishmael’s intensity mounts as he reaches for the concluding line: “Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt?” But before he poses this question, his dismay at the physical world’s deceptiveness achieves its most forceful expression: “so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house within.” The British edition expurgates the line not only for its graphic image of a painted prostitute and a warehouse for dead bodies but also for its equating “deified Nature,” that is, God’s creation, with prostitution and death.
</note>; and when we proceed further, and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great principle of light, for ever remains white or colorless in itself, and if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects, even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge—pondering all this, the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful travellers in <ref target="#ref_19999">Lapland</ref><note xml:id="ref_19999"><ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:219">Lapland</ref>: a region covering northern Scandinavia and Russia as well as Finland that contains rugged mountains, swamps, and meadowlands; it is the home of the Sami people, often called Lapps.</note>, who refuse to wear colored and coloring glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him. And of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt?
