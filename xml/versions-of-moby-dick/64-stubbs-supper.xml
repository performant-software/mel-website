It was a calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen men with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved. For, upon the <ref target="#ref_17399">great canal of Hang-Ho</ref><note xml:id="ref_17399">great canal of Hang-Ho: The Grand Canal (Yun-ho or Chah-ho) follows in part the former bed of the Huang-ho (Yellow River).</note>, or whatever they call it, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will draw a bulky freighted <ref target="#ref_20739">junk</ref><note xml:id="ref_20739">junk: Flat-bottomed sailing vessel.</note> at the rate of a mile an hour; but this grand <ref target="#ref_17405">argosy</ref><note xml:id="ref_17405">argosy: large merchant vessel.</note> we towed heavily forged along, as if laden with <ref target="#ref_17406">pig-lead</ref><note xml:id="ref_17406">pig-lead: small cast-lead bars often used for ballast.</note> in bulk.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod’s main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night, and then <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1518214895369-qln515sssnl-4163556d076c4e967e36e47cb5fc340d%2FMD_Amer_0362.jpg"/> handing his lantern to a seaman, went his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until morning.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had evinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the creature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or despair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not one jot advance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought from the sound on the Pequod’s decks, that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel’s, and seen through the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the two—<name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:1089" type="artwork">ship and whale</name>, seemed yoked together like colossal <ref target="#ref_17407">bullocks</ref><note xml:id="ref_17407">bullocks: steers.</note>, whereof one reclines while the other remains standing.*

* [Melville's Note] A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside, is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to put the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end, and a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship. By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes.

Such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affairs. One small, helping cause of all this liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely manifest. Stubb was a high liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate.

Sharks do not chew their food, but bolt down large pieces gouged out with their many teeth. The word is close to literal with reference to sharks, and no doubt chosen for its alliteration with “mingling” and “mastication.” In an early draft of his late poem “The Maldive Shark,” Melville speaks of the shark as “Pale mumbler of horrible meat,” which he later revised to “Pale ravener.”</note> with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks, swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its <ref target="#ref_21962">fatness</ref><note xml:id="ref_21962">the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness: Here, fatness, frequently used in the Bible, is both wealth and corpulence, as in “the fatness of the earth” (Genesis 27.39) and “the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean” (Isaiah 17.4). This usage, along with the mention of “leviathan” adds an unexpected biblical tone to the sharkish feasting.</note>. The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few inches of the sleepers’ hearts. Peering over the side you could just see them (as before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head. This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous. How, at such an apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem of all things.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship’s decks, like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other’s live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks, also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing, that is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or <ref target="#ref_21963">a dead slave</ref><note xml:id="ref_21963">a dead slave to be decently buried: From a variety of causes, an estimated 10 to 15 percent of African slaves died on these infamous “Middle Passage” voyages in the early nineteenth century. Dead slaves, and some of the living, were tossed over the side in a burial anything but “decent.” Soon after embarking on his first whaling voyage, Melville's ship Acushnet moored in Rio de Janeiro's bay not far from The Crescent, a hospital ship that treated emaciated and dying Africans "recaptured" from slave ships, seized by British naval vessels patroling the South Atlantic. See Bryant, <hi rend="italic">Herman Melville: A Half Known Life</hi>, vol. 2, ch. 69.</note> to be decently buried; and though one or two other like instances might be set down, touching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do most socially congregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm whale, moored by night to a whale-ship at sea. If you have never seen that sight, then suspend your decision about <ref target="#MDch64Note1">the propriety <hi rend="bold">of devil-worship,</hi> and <hi rend="bold">the</hi> expediency of conciliating the devil</ref><note xml:id="MDch64Note1">REVISION NARRATIVE: the propriety <hi rend="bold">of devil-worship,</hi> and <hi rend="bold">the</hi> expediency of conciliating the devil. // Ishmael’s grim-comic two-paragraph meditation on the host of sharks feasting in horrific unison on a dead sperm whale—in contrast to the more randomly disposed victims of the “diabolism of a sea-fight” or slavery—elaborates on the “devilish brilliance” of sharks as representatives of the “universal cannibalism of the sea” in Ch. 58 (“Brit”) and anticipates further discussion on meat-eating in general, developed in Chs. 65 and 66 (“The Whale as a Dish” and “The Shark Massacre”). The meditation’s concluding line insinuates that the “hilarity” of the sharks’ feasting is evidence of the sharkish, cannibalistic nature of our humanity and a demonism in the world that would justify “devil-worship.” Later, Melville develops Ahab’s obsession into a similar sympathy for the devil when Ahab baptizes a newly-forged harpoon barb “in nomine diaboli” (in the name of the devil). Elevating Ahab’s obsessional behavior to the demonic is sourced not only in Milton’s Satan and Shelley’s Prometheus but also in more contemporary reading; see note on “Ego non baptizo” in Ch. 113 (“The Forge”).
<lb/><lb/>The British edition removed “of devil-worship” and “the,” leaving “the propriety and expediency of conciliating the devil,” thus eliminating any condoning of “devil-worship” or breaking of the third commandment: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” An editor is the likely reviser here; however, the retention of the still blasphemous “conciliating the devil” seems out of keeping with other British expurgations. Equally likely, then, is that Melville moderated the line, not simply to eliminate the repetition of “devil” but because “worship” suggests an idolization of, rather than sympathy for, universal demonism.

By 1850, minstrel shows, in which white entertainers in burnt-cork makeup performed slave stereotypes in blackface, were highly popular, reflecting white audiences' peculiar blend of guilt, affection, and disdain for Black slaves. Melville’s attempts to render African-American dialect with Fleece echo that tradition, and three revisions (either by Melville or his editors) to Fleece’s sermon to the sharks reveal complexities in such racializations.
<lb/><lb/>To begin with, the spelling of Black dialect was a problem. The expression “Do you is all sharks”—with “Do” pronounced dough to mean “Though”—was confusing enough, and either Melville or his British editor changed "Do" to “Dough” to prevent confusion with the verb to do. The NN edition also adopts “Dough,” but since this word is also confusing, Longman and MEL retain “Do.” For two other revision narratives on dialect in this chapter, see "helping yourselbs" and "dood right."

One possible implication of Fleece’s familiarity with a church in Cape-Town is that he had been a kidnapped African returned to South Africa, which would contradict his earlier claim of having been born a native African American slave in the "Roanoke country" of Virginia.</note>,” said the old man sullenly.

In 2 Kings, the prophet Elijah is taken to heaven in a chariot of fire: “behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, . . .
and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven” (2.11). Reducing this memorable and stirring biblical image to a modern “coach and four”
was irreverent enough to induce an editor to cut the reference altogether, for the British wording is merely “Fetch him—and fetch him where?”

Sailors can reach the "top" or “Main-top” (a platform that surrounds the place where the lower mast and topmast meet, and a base for the topmast’s “shrouds,” or support rigging) by climbing the shrouds of the lower mast and then, by holding on to other rigging, perilously scrambling over the edge of the platform onto its upper side. They can also take the scorned, easy way by squeezing through the "lubber’s hole" at the center of the platform, the narrow opening around the mast intended to accommodate rigging. Stubb’s salty message is nothing more than a seaman’s version of the truism that you cannot get to heaven the easy way, but his seemingly careless attitude toward this “ticklish business” of salvation may have been read as disrespectful; hence the expurgation.
