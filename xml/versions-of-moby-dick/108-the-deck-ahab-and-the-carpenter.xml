AHAB AND THE CARPENTER
THE DECK—FIRST NIGHT WATCH.

Those buckskin legs and calves of legs I’ve seen in shop windows wouldn’t compare at all. They soak water, they do; and of course get rheumatic, and have to be doctored (sneezes) with washes and lotions, just like live legs. There; before I saw it off, now, I must call his old Mogulship, and see whether the length will be all right; too short, if anything, I guess. Ha! that’s the heel; we are in luck; here he comes, or it’s somebody else, that’s certain.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Just in time, sir. If the captain pleases, I will now mark the length. Let me measure, sir.

How the soot flies! This must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Truly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard something curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still pricking him at times. May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It is, man. Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was; so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the soul. Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there, there to a hair, do I. Is’t a riddle?

In thy most solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don’t speak! And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be now so long dissolved; then, why mayst not thou, carpenter, feel the fiery pains of hell for ever, and without a body? Hah!

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Good Lord! Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over again; I think I didn’t carry a small figure, sir.

And here’s his leg! Yes, now that I think of it, here’s his bedfellow! has a stick of whale’s jaw-bone for a wife! And this is his leg; he’ll stand on this. What was that now about one leg standing in three places, and all three places standing in one hell—how was that? Oh! I don’t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I’m a sort of strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that’s only haphazard-like.

Earlier references in Moby-Dick to the Last Judgment are: “did’st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?” (Ch. 18); “Tell ’em it’s the resurrection; they must . . . come to judg-ment” (Ch. 40); “Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered more” (Ch. 51); “it will be more tolerable for that provident Fejee, I say, in the day of judgment, than for thee” (Ch. 65); “It smells like the left wing of the day of judgment” (Ch. 96); “Daggoo roused the sleepers with . . . judgment claps” (Ch. 133).

Resurrection Fellow // 
The carpenter recognizes that Ahab’s obsessive spirit outlasts the captain’s natural and prosthetic legs, and he hurries along the replacement of Ahab’s new leg, noting that the “resurrection fellow” will soon enough signal the demise of all legs (that is, bodies) come Judgment Day. In Islamic, Jewish, and Christian traditions that final day is announced by the blowing of a horn. The good and the evil are divided, and the good are reborn or resurrected into eternal life. Melville alludes to this apocalyptic event throughout Moby-Dick, and here, as the novel approaches its own cataclysmic conclusion, the carpenter’s commentary underscores the image as it prefigures the Pequod’s demise. But British editors found the playful reference to the horn-blowing Gabriel as a “fellow,” and one likened to a “brewery-man,” to be irreverent; they cut the entire passage from the word "before" to the end of the sentence.
