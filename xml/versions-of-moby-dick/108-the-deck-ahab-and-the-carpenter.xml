I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that old Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a blacksmith, and animated them with fire; for what’s made in fire must properly belong to fire; and so hell’s probable.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Truly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard something curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still pricking him at times. May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It is, man. Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was; so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the soul. Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there, there to a hair, do I. Is’t a riddle?

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I should humbly call it a poser, sir.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hist, then. How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy spite? In thy most solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don’t speak! And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be now so long dissolved; then, why mayst not thou, carpenter, feel the fiery pains of hell for ever, and without a body? Hah!

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Good Lord! Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over again; I think I didn’t carry a small figure, sir.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Look ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.—How long before the leg is done?

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Perhaps an hour, sir.

Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says he’s queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer; he’s queer, says Stubb; he’s queer—queer, queer; and keeps dinning it into Mr. Starbuck all the time—queer, sir—queer, queer, very queer. And here’s his leg! Yes, now that I think of it, here’s his bedfellow! has a stick of whale’s jaw-bone for a wife! And this is his leg; he’ll stand on this. What was that now about one leg standing in three places, and all three places standing in one hell—how was that? Oh! I don’t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I’m a sort of strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that’s only haphazard-like. Then, a short, little old body like me, should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall, heron-built captains; the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick, and there’s a great cry for life-boats.

Now, for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must be because they use them mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old coach-horses. But Ahab; oh he’s a hard driver. Look, driven one leg to death, and <ref target="#ref_18510">spavined</ref><note xml:id="ref_18510">spavined: crippled, normally said of horses.</note> the other for life, and now wears out bone legs by the cord.

In Islamic, Jewish, and Christian traditions that final day is announced by the blowing of a horn. The good and the evil are divided, and the good are reborn or resurrected into eternal life. Melville alludes to this apocalyptic event throughout Moby-Dick (see contextual note for "resurrection fellow"), and here, as the novel approaches its own cataclysmic conclusion, the carpenter’s commentary underscores the image as it prefigures the Pequod’s demise. But British editors found the playful reference to the horn-blowing resurrectionist as a “fellow,” and one likened to a “brewery-man,” to be irreverent; they cut the highlighted passage.

<note xml:id="ref_18520">the resurrection fellow: A reference to the Last Judgment or Apocalypse, when the good are resurrected into eternal life. The fellow may be either “the Son of man” (Jesus) who “shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet” (Matthew 24.30–31) or the archangel Gabriel who, in Judeo-Christian tradition (though not in the Bible) will announce the resurrection of the dead: “for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed” (1 Corinthians 15.52). Earlier references in Moby-Dick to the Last Judgment are: “did’st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?” (Ch. 18); “Tell ’em it’s the resurrection; they must . . . come to judgment” (Ch. 40); “Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered more” (Ch. 51); “it will be more tolerable for that provident Fejee, I say, in the day of judgment, than for thee” (Ch. 65); “It smells like the left wing of the day of judgment” (Ch. 96); “Daggoo roused the sleepers with . . . judgment claps” (Ch. 133). In addition, Ishmael refers to the angel Gabriel in Ch. 1 and again with the prophet-sailor Gabriel in Ch. 71. (See also the Revision Narrative for this passage.)</note>
