The diver sun—slow dived from noon,—goes down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then, the crown too heavy that I wear? this <ref target="#ref_16567"><name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:1080" type="artwork">Iron Crown of Lombardy</name></ref><note xml:id="ref_16567">Iron Crown of Lombardy: Ancient jewelled crown used at coronations of the Holy Roman emperors, and supposed to contain a nail from the cross on which Jesus was crucified. Unlike Ahab’s metaphorical crown, the original is mainly gold.</note>. Yet is it bright with many a gem; I, the wearer, see not its far flashings; but darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. ’Tis iron—that I know—not gold. ’Tis split, too—that I feel; the jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to beat

The final two clauses introduce Ahab's steel skull, which, he says, obviates his having to wear a “helmet” or iron crown.  The British version deletes these two clauses so that the paragraph ends with “solid metal.” A British editor would have had no reason to remove these words, though a printer might have inadvertently omitted them in setting type. A likelier scenario, however, is that Melville found the extended metamorphizing confusing and made the deletion himself in the proof sheets he sent to England.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Dry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred me, so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne’er enjoy. Gifted with the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise! Good night—good night!

Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all stand before me; and I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire others, the match itself must needs be wasting!

In Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Symposium</hi> and in Romantic poetry, a “dæmon” mediates between heaven and earth or gives human form to ideal truths. In this sense, Ahab’s demonism is more spiritual than supernatural.</note>, I am madness maddened! That wild madness that’s only calm to comprehend itself!

I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer. Now, then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one. That’s more than ye, ye great gods, ever were.

Thompson was never blind, and Melville's epithet "blinded" may have to do with temporary sight impairment due to common enough facial swellings in the ring.</note>!
