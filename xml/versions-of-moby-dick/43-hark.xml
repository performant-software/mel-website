HARK!

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It was the <ref target="#ref_21329">middle-watch</ref><note xml:id="ref_21329">the middle-watch . . . scuttle-butt: Sometime during the midnight to 4 AM watch, the men stand in a line to convey buckets of water from the large barrels of drinking water in the middle of the ship to the small cask of water for daily use, kept on deck near the rail around the stern.</note>: a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in a cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to the scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the buckets to fill the <ref target="#ref_21330">scuttle-butt</ref><note xml:id="ref_21330">scuttle-butt: cask from which sailors drew their daily ration of water</note>. Standing, for the most part, on the hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet. From hand to hand, the buckets went in the deepest silence, only broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“There it is again—under the hatches—don’t you hear it—a cough—it sounded like a cough.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Cough be damned! Pass along that return bucket.”
