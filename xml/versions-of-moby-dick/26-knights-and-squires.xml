He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:39" type="place"><ref target="#ref_20636">Indies</ref><note xml:id="ref_20636">the Indies: India.</note></name>, his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time of general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It was merely the condensation of the man. He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a <ref target="#ref_16325">patent chronometer</ref><note xml:id="ref_16325">patent chronometer: exceptionally precise timepiece used in navigation; a major metaphor in <hi rend="italic">Pierre</hi>.</note>, his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted through life. A staid, steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame chapter of
<ref target="#MDch26Note2">sounds</ref>.<note xml:id="MDch26Note2">The editors of the NN <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi> revise “sounds” to “words” on the basis of a perceived aesthetic imbalance between “pantomime of action” and “chapter of sounds.” According to their argument, just as “a pantomime consists of actions; [so then] a chapter consists of words (not sounds)” (NN <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi> 849). They further speculate that Melville's inscription of “words” in the unrecovered manuscript might have been misread  by an amanuensis (presumably a sister) as “sounds.” While this is not impossible, given Melville’s handwriting, the idea that “chapters” are without “sounds” is debatable. MEL retains the American reading.</note>
 Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1471298633270-cq0bbnb7wf-e572416c1c2f52fcdedf099912a28c8b%2FMD_Amer_0163.jpg"/> with a deep natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some <ref target="#ref_16326">organizations</ref><note xml:id="ref_16326">organizations: personalities.</note> seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories of his young <ref target="#ref_16327">Cape wife</ref><note xml:id="ref_16327">Cape wife: from Cape Cod.</note> and child, tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to those latent influences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. “I will have no man in my boat,” said Starbuck, “who is not afraid of a whale.” By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Aye, aye,” said Stubb, the second mate, “Starbuck, there, is as careful a man as you’ll find anywhere in this fishery.” But we shall ere long see what that word “careful” precisely means when used by a man like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a sentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all <ref target="#MDch26Note3"><hi rend="bold">mortally</hi> practical occasions</ref><note xml:id="MDch26Note3">REVISION NARRATIVE: <hi rend="bold">mortally</hi> practical occasions // Here, Melville's phrasing means something like "deadly work situations." The British edition omits the word “mortally”; the deletion lessens the meaning, though minimally, given the context, and may be authorial, or simply a printer's oversight.

Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this <ref target="#ref_16328">critical</ref><note xml:id="ref_16328">critical: dangerous, risky.</note> ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew. What doom was his own father’s? Where, in <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1471298645046-2ois78k39h2-e572416c1c2f52fcdedf099912a28c8b%2FMD_Amer_0164.jpg"/> the bottomless deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in him, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its confinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it was that sort of <ref target="#MDch26Note4"><hi rend="bold">bravery chiefly, visible</hi></ref><note xml:id="MDch26Note4">REVISION NARRATIVE: that sort of <hi rend="bold">bravery chiefly, visible</hi> in some intrepid men // The placement of commas affects meaning in this passage.  In general, Melville’s comma placement, especially evident in manuscript and before editorial intervention, is more rhetorical than structural; that is, his commas indicate rhythms of speech or word emphasis rather than sentence structure. In the American edition, the comma placement in this sentence indicates  something like “it was <hi rend="bold">chiefly that</hi> sort of bravery that is visible in some intrepid men.” The British edition drops the comma so that the adverb “chiefly” can modify either “was” or “visible.” However, the editors of the NN <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi> reposition the comma after “bravery” so that the meaning is “it was that sort of bravery that is <hi rend="bold">chiefly visible</hi> in some intrepid men.” In keeping with its policy of not mixing versions or, in this case, “improving” Melville’s punctuation, MEL makes no change.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But were the coming narrative to reveal, in any instance, the complete abasement of poor Starbuck’s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart to write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose the fall of valor in the soul. Men may seem detestable as joint stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be; men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes. That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so far within us, that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined man. Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight, completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars. But this august dignity I treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture. Thou shalt see it <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1471298658686-kuz6d1fkl4l-e572416c1c2f52fcdedf099912a28c8b%2FMD_Amer_0165.jpg"/> shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that democratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from God; Himself!
<ref target="#MDch26Note1"><hi rend="bold">The great God absolute! The centre and circumference of all democracy! His omnipresence, our divine equality!</hi></ref><note xml:id="MDch26Note1">REVISION NARRATIVE: God and Democracy // On the heels of describing Starbuck’s courage, but also the possible limits of that courage, Ishmael argues that our admiration for such individuals stems from our recognition of an “immaculate manliness” within humankind that underpins all individuals’ strengths and weaknesses. However, where he pushes the argument to encompass kings, democracy, and God, British editors began to cut. Although the phrase “democratic dignity” remains in the British version, the three sentences concluding that paragraph and linking human equality to divine order were expurgated in deference to the monarchy. In the next paragraph, the word “democratic” (in bold) is also removed, reducing “thou great democratic God” to “thou great God!” To compare American and British pages, click the thumbnails in the right margin.</note> <pb facs="/images/md-british-v1/MD_Brit_v1_0200.jpg"/>
