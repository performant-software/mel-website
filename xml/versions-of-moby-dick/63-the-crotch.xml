THE CROTCH

It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length, which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the prow. Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall. It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch, respectively called the first and second irons.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with the line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one instantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the coming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It is a doubling of the chances. But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into him. Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the line, and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line (mentioned in a <ref target="#ref_21959">preceding chapter</ref><note xml:id="ref_21959">preceding chapter: “The Line” (Ch. 60).</note>) making this feat, in most instances, prudently practicable. But this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror, skittishly <ref target="#ref_17368">curvetting</ref><note xml:id="ref_17368">curvetting: prancing like a horse.</note> about both boat and whale, entangling the lines, or cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all directions. Nor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these qualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him. For, of course, each boat is supplied with several harpoons to <ref target="#ref_20737">bend on</ref><note xml:id="ref_20737">bend on: To attach using a knot such as a sheet bend; in this case, the eye-splice at the end of the line that encircles the harpoon head and is lashed to the shaft of the harpoon is "bent on," or attached, to the whale-line, most commonly with a knot known as a double-becket hitch or double sheet bend.</note> to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery. All these particulars are faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to elucidate several most important, however intricate passages, in scenes hereafter to be painted.</p></div></body>
