</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">IN this same New Bedford there stands a <ref target="#ref_15737">Whaleman’s Chapel</ref><note xml:id="ref_15737">Whaleman’s Chapel: Melville attended a service there before sailing in January 1841. The rebuilt <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:101">New Bedford Seamen's Bethel</ref>, on the walls of which the memorial tablets Ishmael mentions can still be seen, is in the same spot on Johnny-Cake Hill.</note>, and few are the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot. I am sure that I did not.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this special errand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving sleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517779542394-vjvasfrsjqe-047c34f6f61235162591944771a71e6c%2FMD_Amer_0075.jpg"/> shaggy jacket of the cloth called <ref target="#ref_15729">bearskin</ref><note xml:id="ref_15729">bearskin: shaggy woolen cloth.</note>, I fought my way against the stubborn storm. Entering, I found a small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors’ wives and widows. A muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm. Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable. The chaplain had not yet arrived; and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit. Three of them ran something like the following, but I do not pretend to quote:—

It is said that near Japan Ahab lost his leg (Ch. 28) and the Pequod her masts (Ch. 18), while, remarkably, the vessel’s new masts came from Japan (Ch. 16) despite the fact that it forbade foreigners to touch there, as emphasized in “That double-bolted land, Japan” (Ch. 24), “impenetrable Japans” (Ch. 111), and “locked Japan” (Ch. 123). Characteristic, high-pooped Japanese junks are alluded to in Chs. 16 and 50, while the Japanese seas are glorious and “resplendent” (Chs. 118 and 199), with their own fabulous whale, named Morquan (Ch. 45).</note>,

<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated myself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near me. Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance. This savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance; because he was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall. Whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation, I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery, and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing among flowers can say—here, here lies my beloved; ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these. What bitter blanks in those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes! What despair in those immovable inscriptions! What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse resurrections to the <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1517779985933-5nd2qi8l1n-047c34f6f61235162591944771a71e6c%2FMD_Amer_0077.jpg"/> beings who have placelessly perished without a grave.

All these things are not without their meanings.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.

Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But somehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine chance for promotion, it seems—aye, a <ref target="#ref_15734">stove boat</ref><note xml:id="ref_15734">stove boat: smashed or punctured boat (in this case by a whale); see present tense form in “stave my soul” in the last sentence.</note> will make me an immortal by <ref target="#ref_15735">brevet</ref><note xml:id="ref_15735">brevet: temporary military promotion sometimes given on the battlefield.</note>. Yes, there is death in this business of whaling—a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what then? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death. Methinks that what they call my <ref target="#ref_21244">shadow</ref><note xml:id="ref_21244">my shadow here on earth is my true substance: Ishmael speaks in contrast to the allegory of the cave in the <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/text:147"><hi rend="italic">Republic</hi></ref> of <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:273">Plato</ref>, in which shadows are only appearances and sunlight is true being.
