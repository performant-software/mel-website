			<head type="sub-head" rend="center"><ref target="#MDch127Note1">THE DECK.</ref></head><note xml:id="MDch127Note1">THE DECK: Some chapter titles listed in the American edition's table of contents do not precisely match the title as it appears on the chapter's title page. In this case, Chapter 127, titled "The Deck" is listed as "Ahab and the Carpenter." The British edition's content listing matches the chapter heading, "The Deck." However, the British version is not a likely correction of a presumed American edition typographical error, although an error seems to have occurred. One likelihood is that Melville's intended title was something like "The Deck. Ahab and the Carpenter," which like similar titles gives both setting and characters, as if the chapter were a scene in a stageplay. Even though this supposed title would reprise the title of Ch. 108, such a repetition might also have been intended.</note>

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Thank ye, man. Thy coffin lies handy to the vault.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Well enough. But art thou not also the undertaker?”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg; but they’ve set me now to turning it into something else.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling, monopolizing, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those same coffins? Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a jack-of-all-trades.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“The gods again. Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin? The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the craters for volcanoes; and <ref target="#ref_18707">the grave-digger in the play</ref><note xml:id="ref_18707">the grave-digger in the play sings, spade in hand: In Hamlet, 5.1.</note> sings, spade in hand. Dost thou never?”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Sing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, I’m indifferent enough, sir, for that; but the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because there was none in his spade, sir. But the calking mallet is full of it. Hark to it.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Aye, and that’s because the lid there’s a sounding-board; and what in all things makes the sounding-board is this—there’s naught beneath. And yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same, Carpenter. Hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the coffin knock against the church-yard gate, going in?”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Faith, sir, I’ve———”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Faith? What’s that?”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Why, faith, sir, it’s only a sort of exclamation-like—that’s all, sir.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Um, um; go on.”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“I was about to say, sir, that———”

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“He goes aft. That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot latitudes.

Seems to me some sort of Equator cuts yon old man, too, right in his middle. He’s always under the Line—fiery hot, I tell ye! He’s looking this way—come, oakum; quick. Here we go again.

Oh! how immaterial are all materials! What things real are there, but imponderable thoughts? Here now’s the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere hap, made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life. A life-buoy of a coffin! Does it go further? Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is, after all, but an immortality-preserver! I’ll think of that. But no. So far gone am I in the dark side of earth, that its other side, the theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain twilight to me. Will ye never have done, Carpenter, with that accursed sound? I go below; let me not see that thing here when I return again. Now, then, Pip, we’ll talk this over; I do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee! Some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds must empty into thee!”</p></div></body>
