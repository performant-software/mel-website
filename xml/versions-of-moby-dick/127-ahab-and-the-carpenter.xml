			<head type="sub-head" rend="center"><ref target="#MDch127Note1">THE DECK.</ref></head><note xml:id="MDch127Note1">THE DECK: Some chapter titles listed in the American edition's table of contents do not precisely match the title as it appears on the chapter's title page. In this case, Chapter 127, titled "The Deck" is listed as "Ahab and the Carpenter." The British edition's content listing matches the chapter heading, "The Deck." However, the British version is not a likely correction of a presumed American edition typographical error, although an error seems to have occurred. One likelihood is that Melville's intended title was something like "The Deck. Ahab and the Carpenter," which like similar titles gives both setting and characters, as if the chapter were a scene in a stageplay. Even though this supposed title would reprise the title of Ch. 108, such a repetition might also have been intended.</note>

There’s a sound!” set up a parallelism imperfectly matched in the subsequent line in which Ahab wishes he might be “Blind and dumb.” This is a sight he does not want to see and a sound he does not want to hear; therefore, “blind and deaf” is the expected phrase. A likely cause of the error is that the phrase “blind and dumb,” repeated in a scene from one of Jesus’ miracles (Matthew 12.22), may have come to mind while Melville was writing. The NN edition emends “dumb” to “deaf.” Because the error does not seriously confuse the reader, MEL makes no change.</note>. See! that thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines. A most malicious wag, that fellow. Rat-tat! So man’s seconds tick! Oh! how immaterial are all materials! What things real are there, but imponderable thoughts?

Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is, after all, but an immortality-preserver! I’ll think of that. But no.

In his soliloquy, Ahab refers to the planet Earth, with its night and day hemispheres. Although the world revolves through these dark and bright regions, Ahab claims he is stuck in the dark side always: for him, the bright side seems only “theoretic,” and twilight (that is, light becoming darkness) is uncertainty. (In a positive inversion of this image found in “Hawthorne and his Mosses,” Melville likens Hawthorne’s fiction, which unites bright and dark views, to an “evermoving dawn.”) But, in the American edition, “earth” (not capitalized and without the definite article) may indicate mere soil, not the actual revolving planet. Of course, Melville may have initially intended this symbolic meaning so that Ahab seems to position himself in the perpetual darkness of materiality (earth); however, “the earth” indicates an equally intentional shift in symbol to the image of the planet, and is congruent with the “twilight” imagery that concludes the sentence. Whether a correction or revision, the change was probably made by Melville and not an editor.
