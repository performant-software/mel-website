THE STREET

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">IF I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:61" type="place">New Bedford</name>.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts. Even in <ref target="#ref_21240">Broadway and Chestnut</ref><note xml:id="ref_21240">Broadway and Chestnut streets . . . Lascars and Malays . . . Bombay, in the Apollo Green: <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:257">Broadway</ref> is in Manhattan, <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:87">Chestnut Street</ref> in Philadelphia, <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:89">Regent Street</ref> in London. <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:92">Water Street</ref> and <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:93">Wapping High Street</ref>, below, are in Liverpool and London, respectively. Lascars and Malays are sailors from <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:39">India</ref> and present-day <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:90">Malaysia</ref>. Apollo Green is a gathering place in Bombay, the Indian seaport now known as <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:91">Mumbai</ref>.</note> streets, Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent street is not unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live Yankees have often scared the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water street and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh. It makes a stranger stare.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But, besides the <ref target="#ref_21241">Feegeeans</ref><note xml:id="ref_21241">Feegeeans, . . . and Brighggians: Pacific islanders; however, the last is Melville’s invention. </note>, Tongatabooans, Erromanggoans, Pannangians, and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still more curious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town scores of green <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:96" type="place">Vermonters</name> and <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:97" type="place">New Hampshire</name> men, all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance. Many are as green as the <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:98" type="place">Green Mountains</name> whence they came. In some things you would think them but a few hours old. Look there! that chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat and

Here comes another with a <ref target="#ref_15712">sou’-wester and a bombazine cloak</ref><note xml:id="ref_15712">sou’-wester and a bombazine cloak: waterproof sailor’s hat with an extra-wide brim at the back; bombazine is a fine fabric of silk and either wool or cotton. </note>.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one—I mean a downright bumpkin dandy—a fellow that, in the <ref target="#ref_15713">dog-days</ref><note xml:id="ref_15713">dog-days: in the Northern Hemisphere, the oppressively hot days of July to September, associated with Sirius, the “dog star.”</note>, will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; <ref target="#ref_15714">straps</ref><note xml:id="ref_15714">straps: suspenders.</note> to his canvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps, buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:1012" type="artwork">New Bedford</name> is a queer place. Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:74" type="place">Labrador</name>. As it is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten one, they look so bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in, in all <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:304" type="place">New England</name>. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not like <ref target="#ref_15720">Canaan</ref><note xml:id="ref_15720">Canaan: Biblical Promised Land rich in agricultural products, Canaan was “flowing with milk and honey”; but its oil was olive, not whale.</note>; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs. Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came they? how planted upon this once scraggy <ref target="#ref_15715">scoria</ref><note xml:id="ref_15715">scoria: slag; lava.</note> of a country?

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:33" type="place">Atlantic</name>, <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:35" type="place">Pacific</name>, and <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:18" type="place">Indian</name> oceans. One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea. <ref target="#ref_15721"><hi rend="bold">Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?</hi></ref><note xml:id="ref_15721">REVISION NARRATIVE: <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:270">German magician Johann Friedrich Alexander Heimburgher (1819-1909)</ref>, who performed as Herr Alexander in the United States in the 1840s, was reported in a Boston newspaper for the day in November 1846 on which Melville  arrived in that city for a visit: His "latest trick is an apparent suicide, wherein, like <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:215">Cato</ref>, the magician falls upon a sword.” Compare Ishmael’s first paragraph, Ch. 1. (See Collamer M. Abbott, “Ishmael and Herr Alexander,” MSEx 84: 10-11.) This sentence does not appear in the British edition: either because of a printer's error or because Melville or an editor did not think British readers would catch the allusion.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for <ref target="#ref_15717">dowers</ref><note xml:id="ref_15717">dowers: dowries; cash or property given by a bride’s family to a bridegroom.</note> to <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1440606441501-rxtdkgbtk6e-bc3c4d30f5dbcb75711b93291713d0c1%2FMD_Amer_0074.jpg"/>their daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece. You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly burn their lengths in <ref target="#ref_15718">spermaceti</ref><note xml:id="ref_15718">spermaceti: waxy oil from the sperm whale’s head, from which the finest candles were made. </note> candles.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples—long avenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful and bountiful horsechestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is art; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation’s final day.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">And the <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:1013" type="artwork">women of New Bedford</name>, they bloom like their own red roses. But roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the <ref target="#ref_15722">seventh heavens</ref><note xml:id="ref_15722">seventh heavens: In Jewish and Islamic tradition, the highest level of Heaven.
