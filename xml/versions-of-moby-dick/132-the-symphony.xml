</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were, that distinguished them.

The British edition expurgates this paragraph, probably for its sexual content, with sky and sea as female and male elements meeting at the horizon, in which the sky-bride surrenders with “throbbing trust” and "loving alarms" (sexual apprehensions) to the sea-groom.

It depicts the sky’s blithe and playful indifference to Ahab’s pain, and describes how air and sky are like children playing with the gray locks encircling a grandfather’s “burnt-out crater” of a brain. The passage (which lacks quotation marks) may be either Ishmael or Ahab speaking, and it recalls the tone, word choice, and uncertain speaker of the “Oh, grassy glades” speech in Ch. 114, “The Gilder.” Because the image is not offensive, Melville rather than an editor might have cut the paragraph to eliminate the apparent interior monologue that too closely echoes Ch. 114 and to move more quickly to Ahab’s dramatic duet with Starbuck.

Why this strife of the chase? why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance? how the richer or better is Ahab now? Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard, that with this weary load I bear, one poor leg should have been snatched from under me? Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep. Locks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes! But do I look very old, so very, very old, Starbuck?

By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is the magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no; stay on board, on board!—lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with the far away home I see in that eye!”

Away! let us away!—this instant let me alter the course! How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl on our way to see old Nantucket again!

Who Adds an It? //
A famous textual puzzle involves the change in Ahab’s self-searching question from its American version (“Is Ahab, Ahab?”) to the British (“Is it Ahab, Ahab?”). The American reading has Ahab question his entire identity at this crucial moment before he then asks the more specific set of questions regarding who motivates his actions: “Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this arm?” The British reading, with the inserted “it,” creates a more direct link between the two sets of questions. But its repetition of “Ahab” seems superfluous and may be taken as Ahab either directly addressing himself or dramatically stressing himself (perhaps with a gesture of disbelief) as his own motivator. One possible explanation for the British version is that Melville intended the British reading all along, but that the “it” was inadvertently omitted in the American edition and then replaced by Melville in the proofs he sent to England. Another possibility is that Melville intended the American reading, then changed his mind and revised the text for the British. Also possible is that a British editor, not comprehending the American reading, added “it” to make Ahab’s self-questioning parallel with the second question. Whether the result of a correction or revision, and whether authorial or editorial, the separate readings have their own logics and are equally meaningful.

But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an errand-boy in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some invisible power; how then can this one small heart beat; this one small brain think thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does that living, and not I. By heaven, man, we are turned round and round in this world, like yonder windlass, and Fate is the handspike. And all the time, lo! that smiling sky, and this unsounded sea! Look! see yon Albicore! who put it into him to chase and fang that flying-fish? Where do murderers go, man! <ref target="#ref_20175">Who’s to doom</ref><note xml:id="ref_20175">Who’s to doom, when the judge himself is dragged to the bar?: Who is left to condemn anyone for murder if the judge himself is on trial? As Melville was composing Moby-Dick, the infamous Webster-Parkman murder case was being tried in Boston by Melville’s father-in-law, Lemuel Shaw, whose ruling against the defendant made him the focus of considerable controversy to the public and among legal scholars. The judge in this line may be a reference to Shaw (Quirk).</note>, when the judge himself is dragged to the bar? But it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and the air smells now, as if it blew from a far-away meadow; they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and the mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping? Aye, toil we how we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep? Aye, and rust amid greenness; as last year’s scythes flung down, and left in the half-cut swaths—Starbuck!”
