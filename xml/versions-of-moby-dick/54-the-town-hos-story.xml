This latter circumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates. For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the Town-Ho himself. It was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to Tashtego with <ref target="#ref_19825">Romish</ref><note xml:id="ref_19825">Romish: Roman Catholic.</note> injunctions of secresy, but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and revealed so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest. Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this matter, that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired <ref target="#ref_21781">abaft</ref><note xml:id="ref_21781">never transpired abaft the Pequod’s main-mast: that is, the secret never reached the officers, whose quarters are at the rear of the ship.</note> the Pequod’s main-mast. Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting record.

Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were on the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket, was cruising in your Pacific here, <ref target="#MDch54Note1">not very many days’ sail eastward</ref><note xml:id="MDch54Note1">not very many days’ sail <hi rend="bold">eastward</hi>: The direction given in both the American and British editions is “eastward,” a likely typo that seems to put the Town-Ho “cruising” impossibly east of Lima’s Golden Inn somewhere in the Andes mountains.

Assuming that “eastward” is a typo, the NN and other editions emend the reading text to “westward”; however, given the possibility of the befuddlement scenario, MEL makes no change.</note> from the eaves of this good Golden Inn.

See Wilson L. Heflin's <hi rend="italic">Herman Melville's Whaling Years</hi> (Ch. 20) for such historical parallels to and possible sources of the Town Ho’s story.</note> had stabbed her, gentlemen. But the captain, having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to quit them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous, though, indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued her cruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no good luck came; more days went by, and not only was the leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much so, that now taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, <ref target="#ref_19829">stood away</ref><note xml:id="ref_19829">stood away: steered a course.</note> for the nearest harbor among the islands, there to have his hull <ref target="#ref_19828">hove out</ref><note xml:id="ref_19828">hove out:  tipped to one side.</note> and repaired.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance favored, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically relieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free; never mind if the leak should double on her. In truth, well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been for the brutal overbearing of <ref target="#MDch54Note2">Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder</ref><note xml:id="MDch54Note2">Radney, the mate, a <hi rend="bold">Vineyarder</hi>: Later in Ch. 54, in both the American and British versions, Radney (here called a “Vineyarder”) is referred to three times as a “Nantucketer.” Although Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket are neighboring islands, they have distinctive histories and cultures, and Ishmael has previously associated radically different characters with these different islands. (Intemperate Flask, for instance, is a Vineyarder, and calm Starbuck, a Nantucketer; each has his “different way,” see Ch. 28.) Therefore, it is unlikely that Melville would want to conflate the two island types, although in writing he might have erred here, or in the other three places, by substituting one island origin for Radney for the other. It is also possible that in the writing process Melville changed his mind about Radney’s origin, but failed to make his text record the change consistently, thus leaving Radney in one place a Vineyarder and in others a Nantucketer. The NN editors revise “Vineyarder” to “Nantucketer” (NN 875). But since the discrepancy might be the vestige of an incomplete revision, MEL makes no change.</note>, and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from <ref target="#ref_20005">Buffalo</ref><note xml:id="ref_20005"><name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:260" type="place">Buffalo</name>: Situated on Lake Erie and New York’s western border, Buffalo was made the western terminus of the Erie Canal in 1822. Its harbor received grain from Chicago via the Great Lakes and sent it on to New York City by canal and river. In the 1840s, it also became a railroad center. In Melville’s day, this western boom town had more than its share of rowdiness and corruption.</note>.”

Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is <hi rend="bold">Buffalo?’</hi>: Quotation Marks // Because “The Town-Ho’s Story” (Ch. 54) was reset from the American edition text in order to appear as a promotional pre-publication excerpt in <hi rend="italic">Harper’s New Monthly Magazine</hi>, its text (like the British version, which was also reset at a later time) exhibits numerous variants, derived from the resetting, that affect meaning, even at the level of the quotation mark. <lb/>The chapter is an interpolated tale within the novel, and in it, Ishmael speaks in different modes: He introduces Lima, where he first told the tale, and reports his interactions with his audience there as well as the dialogue of the characters at sea in the story proper. To represent these narrative layers, Melville uses double and single quotation marks. Because Ishmael proposes to “preserve the style in which [he] once narrated” the tale, the story is, in effect, one long quotation, indicated by double quotation marks. However, the interruptions by Don Pedro and Don Sebastian at the Golden Inn and his dialogue with them at the beginning and end are set off in single quotation marks, as are the speeches of such characters as Radney, Steelkilt, and the Captain within the tale itself. Also, in accordance with punctuation conventions, double quotation marks do not close a paragraph if the speaker continues in the next paragraph; only the last paragraph of a multi-paragraph passage takes a closing double quotation mark. <lb/>But these general rules are not perfectly followed in the American edition, and re-settings of the text in the Harper’s and British versions add as many errors as corrections. In addition, the NN edition makes over 80 changes to the quotation marks in their reading text; some of them are corrections, but most replace with double quotes the American edition’s single quotes from the dialogue of the Dons. For instance, in the highlighted passage, the NN edition reading is “Lakeman! . . . Buffalo?” rather than “‘Lakeman! . . . Buffalo?’  MEL retains the single quotes, and makes seventeen corrections to the American version (as listed in Variants Not Discussed).</note> said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.

Thus, gentlemen, though an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney, though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was he quite as vengeful <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1471210289490-c95stannpt-38ba017a1459046b9d2e57ecabffd50d%2FMD_Amer_0310.jpg"/> and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled <ref target="#ref_21801">Bowie-knives</ref><note xml:id="ref_21801">the latitudes of . . .

Yet was this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave’s right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile. At all events, he had proved so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt—but, gentlemen, you shall hear.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho’s leak seemed again increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day. You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom. Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters, some really landless latitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted, <ref target="#ref_19831">sheeted home</ref><note xml:id="ref_19831">sheeted home: extended horizontally as far as possible by hauling on the sheets (ropes attached to the sails’ lower corners).</note> anew, and every way expanded to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a coward, <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1471210300889-gdkbfmvnsy-38ba017a1459046b9d2e57ecabffd50d%2FMD_Amer_0311.jpg"/> and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her. So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen—that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee <ref target="#ref_19832">scupper-holes</ref><note xml:id="ref_19832">lee scupper-holes: drain holes where the deck meets the sides of the ship.</note>.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours—watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern’s tower, and make a little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head <ref target="#ref_19833">like a Roman</ref><note xml:id="ref_19833">head like a Roman: like the idealized heads on Roman statuary or coins. </note>, and a flowing golden beard like the <ref target="#ref_21802">tasseled housings</ref><note xml:id="ref_21802">tasseled housings of your last viceroy’s snorting charger: Decorated saddle-coverings (housings) for the war-horse of the most recent ruler (viceroy) of Peru and most of Spanish America under the King of Spain, whose colonial rule ended in 1821.</note> of your last viceroy’s snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt <ref target="#ref_20014">Charlemagne</ref><note xml:id="ref_20014">Charlemagne: King of the Franks and the first Holy Roman Emperor, Charles the Great or <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:421">Charlemagne</ref> (742-814), united most of Europe.

But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious. He did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with his gay banterings.

The fact is, boys, that sword-fish only began the job; he’s come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole posse of ’em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom; making improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I’d tell him to jump overboard and scatter ’em. They’re playing the devil with his estate, I can tell him. But he’s a simple old soul,—Rad, and a beauty too. Boys, they say the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses. I wonder if he’d give a poor devil like me the model of his nose.’

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“‘Damn your eyes! what’s that pump stopping for?’ roared Radney, pretending not to have heard the sailor’s talk. ‘Thunder away at it!’

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“‘Aye, aye, sir,’ said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. ‘Lively, boys, lively, now!’ And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life’s utmost energies.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow. Now what <ref target="#ref_19835">cozening</ref><note xml:id="ref_19835">cozening: beguiling, seductive.</note> fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know not; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship’s deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neat-<pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1471210331286-vnm0xhr8hfp-38ba017a1459046b9d2e57ecabffd50d%2FMD_Amer_0313.jpg"/>ness in seamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat in his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated his intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it was to no purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“‘Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to yourself.’ But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions. Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale.

Throughout “The Town-Ho’s Story,” the working-class “ye” (probably pronounced yuh) is reserved almost exclusively for sailor dialogue, whereas Ishmael and the gentlemen Dons speak with more sophisticated diction, referring almost exclusively to each other as “you.” An exception, however, is that Ishmael uses “ye” twice in conversation with the Dons, here at the beginning of the story, with “I will tell ye,” and again at the end, with “the story I have told ye.” Chances are, Melville’s strategy in revising Ishmael’s “ye” to “you” was to make Ishmael speak only like the Dons in the tale’s frame, and never like the sailors featured in the tale. But while he made that revision in the first instance, he failed to do so in the second. As with the Vineyarder-Nantucketer problem (see above), the discrepancy indicates an incomplete revision.

But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale man, with a bandaged head, arrested them—Radney the chief mate.

On the contrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt’s instigation, they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing—namely, not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For, spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till all was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief mate’s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the head of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship’s side. In this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his next <ref target="#ref_19850">trick</ref><note xml:id="ref_19850">trick: In <hi rend="italic">Two Years Before the Mast</hi>, Richard Henry Dana defines "trick" as the "time allotted to a man” at the tiller.</note> at the helm would come round at two o’clock, in the morning of the <ref target="#ref_20026">third day</ref><note xml:id="ref_20026">third day from that in which he had been betrayed: The language evokes the betrayal of Jesus and his resurrection on the third day after the Crucifixion, which, according to Harold Beaver in his edition of <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi>, is itself suggested by the “tableau” of the three sailors tied in the rigging.</note> from that in which he had been betrayed.

It was given him—neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the Lakeman’s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent helm—nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman’s hand—that fatal hour was then to come; and in the fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.

All was now a phrensy. ‘The White Whale—the White Whale!’ was the cry from captain, mates, and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumors, were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass, that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea.

The mutineer was the <ref target="#ref_19852">bowsman</ref><note xml:id="ref_19852">bowsman: man who pulls the second oar from the bow (front) of the whaleboat, directly behind the harpooneer; Melville himself served as a bowsman, as does Ishmael.</note> of the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats were lowered, the mate’s got the start; and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat. And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale’s topmost back. Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale’s slippery back, the boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck out through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went down.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Meantime, at the first tap of the boat’s bottom, the Lakeman had slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific, downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose again, with some tatters of Radney’s red woollen shirt, caught in the teeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.

But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked his muskets on the <ref target="#ref_19853">poop</ref><note xml:id="ref_19853">poop: raised section of the deck at the stern. </note>; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best whaleboat, steered straight before the wind for <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:191" type="place">Tahiti</name>, five hundred miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals.

The captain presented a pistol.

“‘Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. ‘As soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder island, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightnings strike me!”’

Procuring the Evangelists //
The reason for the removal of this sentence from the British edition is not entirely clear. The evangelists are Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the disciples of Jesus who wrote the four Gospels; and the book called The Evangelists that Ishmael is requesting is a New Testament containing these four scriptures and perhaps some other New Testament writings. (Such short-version Bibles are commonly found in English.) Ishmael is proposing to swear on such a Bible that he is telling the truth, and since there is no blasphemy in doing so, it is unlikely that an editor would cut the line for that reason. However, in this sentence, Ishmael insists upon procuring the largest Bible available, thus comically suggesting that the truth of his tale and his sincerity in telling it will be sanctioned by the size of the book he swears by. An editor might have found Ishmael’s flippancy to be irreverent, if not blasphemous, and therefore removed the line. On the other hand, the line’s humor also undercuts the serious tone of the swearing scene to come, and its implications of insincerity undercut Ishmael’s credibility. With these problems in mind, we can argue that Melville is just as likely to have removed the line as an editor.
