But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the largest of the whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete. Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at last come for a new proclamation. This is <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:159" type="place"><ref target="#ref_19714">Charing Cross</ref><note xml:id="ref_19714">Charing Cross: old London city center where new monarchs were proclaimed.</note></name>; hear ye! good people all,—the Greenland whale is deposed,—the great sperm whale now reigneth!

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale’s and Bennett’s; both in their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific description. As yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in any literature. Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten life.

Another possibility has to do with the word “draught” (pronounced draft), meaning a sketch or one of any number of attempts at writing. In this scenario, Melville might have deleted the line because its phrasing—“the draught of a systemization”—anticipates and (perhaps)  diminishes the impact of the chapter’s famous, concluding line: “This whole book is but a draught—nay, but the draught of a draught.” To compare American and British pages, click the thumbnails in the right margin.</note> <pb facs="/images/md-british-v1/MD_Brit_v1_0228.jpg"/> systematization of cetology.

There are some preliminaries to settle.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his <ref target="#MDch32Note2">System of Nature, A. D. 1776</ref>,<note xml:id="MDch32Note2">In his System of Nature, A.D. 1776: Melville's publication date for Linnaeus's <hi rend="italic">Systema Naturae</hi> is inaccurate and has vexed some editors. Linnaeus first published a version of <hi rend="italic">Systema Naturae</hi> as a pamphlet in 1735; the pamphlet grew into a multivolume work, with its tenth edition appearing in 1758. His last edition, appearing in 1766–68, provided a taxonomy for animals. That said, Melville derived the details and quotations from Linnaeus in this chapter largely from the <hi rend="italic">Penny Cyclopaedia</hi> article on “Whales,” which cites the 1766 edition. The editors of the NN <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi> treat Melville’s “1776” date as a typo and change it to the <hi rend="italic">Penny Cyclopaedia</hi> source date, “1766.” However, since “Cetology” is something of a declaration of independence from systemization, Melville’s “1776” may well be an intended joke. In keeping with its policy of not correcting Melville’s errors unless they might confuse readers, MEL makes no change.</note> <ref target="#ref_19930">Linnæus declares</ref><note xml:id="ref_19930">Linnæus declares: Carl von Linné (1707–1778), pioneering Swedish botanist, who developed the system of binomial nomenclature (genus, species) for the classification of plants and animals, wrote under the Latinized name Linnæus, and published <hi rend="italic">Systema Naturae</hi>, in increasingly expanded editions, from 1735 to 1768.</note>, “I hereby separate the whales from the fish.” But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnæus’s express edict, were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The grounds upon which Linnæus would fain have banished the whales from the waters, he states as follows: “<ref target="#ref_19716">On account of their warm bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,” and finally, “ex lege naturæ jure meritoque</ref><note xml:id="ref_19716">“On account of their warm bilocular heart, . . . penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,” . . . “ex lege naturæ jure meritoque.”: as quoted in the <hi rend="italic">Penny Cyclopaedia</hi>; bilocular means two-chambered; the Latin reads, “a penis that enters the female, who gives milk from teats,” and, “by the law of nature, justly and deservedly.”</note>." I submitted all this to my friends <ref target="#ref_19717">Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin</ref><note xml:id="ref_19717">Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin: invented men with typical Nantucket names.</note>, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1471113131982-iibqi51n21-d5c59d80eaeb52493b5639b58293da29%2FMD_Amer_0185.jpg"/> altogether insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon <ref target="#ref_21735">holy Jonah</ref><note xml:id="ref_21735">call upon holy Jonah to back me: "holy Jonah" may refer to the Bible's Book of Jonah or the book's putative author, the prophet.  Either way, Ishmael's facetious appeal to "old-fashioned" biblical thinking is a spoof on the rationality of science.  Father Mapple’s sermon in Ch. 9 retells Jonah's story.</note> to back me. This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnæus has given you those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a whale is <hi rend="italic">a spouting fish with a horizontal tail</hi>. There you have him. However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.* Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be included in

But as these pig-fish are a nosy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials as whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.

All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philosophically considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was that <ref target="#ref_19721">quickening humor</ref><note xml:id="ref_19721">quickening humor: life-giving fluid; here, whale semen.</note> of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses.

It was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of <ref target="#ref_19722">rhubarb</ref><note xml:id="ref_19722">rhubarb: a laxative.</note>. When, as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived.

His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end.

How then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then, this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen; but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis.

* [Melville's Note] <ref target="#MDch32Note1">Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain</ref>.<note xml:id="MDch32Note1">Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain: "Plain" to a bibliographer or book historian but not necessarily to most modern readers. Bookish Ishmael's dilemma is that while the standard book sizes in book-making decrease in size, the second size—the Quarto—is not proportional to the others. This condition has to do with how a single sheet of paper is folded for each size. In Folio books, a single sheet is folded once to give four pages. Quartos are folded twice to give eight smaller pages, and so on. But the Quarto differs in proportion from the other book-sizes; it is squarish rather than longish. Ishmael's facetious reasoning is that since all sizes of whales have basically the same shape, the Quarto shaped book cannot be an adequate category for the next smaller type of whale, so Ishmael arbitrarily eliminates the category from his already facetiously arbitrary classifications, making his "system" all the less systematic, and all the more comic.</note> Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure, yet the bookbinder’s Quarto volume in its diminished form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume does.

In shape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and gentlemanlike figure. He has no fins on his back (most other porpoises have), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental <ref target="#ref_19952">Indian eyes</ref><note xml:id="ref_19952">sentimental Indian eyes: A romantic cliché combining India and sentimental love, as in Shelley’s “Indian Serenade.”</note> of a hazel hue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all. Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark in a ship’s hull, called the <ref target="#ref_19953">“bright waist,”</ref><note xml:id="ref_19953">“bright waist”: Broad band of white paint around the hull. On it black squares resembling gun-ports were some-times painted to deter pirate attack.</note> that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate colors, black above and white below. The white comprises part of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag. A most mean and mealy aspect! His oil is much like that of the common porpoise.

I shall enumerate them by their forecastle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun. If any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then he can readily be incorporated into this System, according to his Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:—The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; &amp;c. From Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities, there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names. But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but <ref target="#ref_19954">signifying nothing</ref><note xml:id="ref_19954">mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing: Echoing Macbeth 5.5, “Life’s but a walking shadow, . . . a tale / Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, / Signifying nothing.”</note>.
