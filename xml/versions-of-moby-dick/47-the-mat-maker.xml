</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1514412602806-kdxwd5wz7rq-a1e8bf23358b12dc73ee7902ba2e4b00%2FMD_Amer_0275.jpg"/> lounging about the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-colored waters. Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat, for an additional <ref target="#ref_17052">lashing</ref><note xml:id="ref_17052">lashing: tie-down used to secure a whaleboat when suspended in its place over the ship’s side.</note> to our boat. So still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of revery lurked in the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while <ref target="#MDch47Note3">busy at the mat</ref><note xml:id="MDch47Note3">busy at the mat: In this scene, partly derived from Francis Allyn Olmsted's <hi rend="italic">Incidents of a Whaling Voyage</hi>, Ishmael assists Queequeg as a "page" might attend his knight. He uses his hand rather than a wooden shuttle, a device employed by weavers, to carry the woof (crosswise thread) of a two-stranded, tarred rope called marline between the fixed, perpendicular strands of the warp. Meanwhile, Queequeg tamps the woof into the warp with a wooden slat, here figured as a "sword," in order to tighten the texture of the “mat” they are weaving on a makeshift loom. Once finished, the mat will help secure their whaleboat when it is suspended over the ship’s side. See <hi rend="italic">Mardi</hi>, Ch. 5: “A broad, braided, hempen band . . . also passed round both gunwales; and secured to the ship’s bulwarks, firmly lashes the [whaleboat] to its place."</note>. As I kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as Queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea, only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as if this were the <ref target="#ref_16878">Loom of Time</ref><note xml:id="ref_16878">Loom of Time: the phrase, found in <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> (1.8), is Thomas Carlyle’s translated quotation from Goethe’s <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> (1.1): “’Tis thus at the roaring Loom of Time I ply, / And weave for God the Garment thou seest Him by.” See Mansfield and Vincent's edition of <hi rend="italic">Moby-Dick</hi> (725).</note>, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own. This warp seemed necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime, Queequeg’s impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be; and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this savage’s sword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance—aye, chance, free will, and necessity—no wise incompatible—all interweavingly working together. The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate course—its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that; free will still <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1514412621020-gmbzclyt9vf-a1e8bf23358b12dc73ee7902ba2e4b00%2FMD_Amer_0276.jpg"/> free to ply her shuttle between given threads; and chance, though restrained in its play within the <ref target="#ref_16885">right</ref><note xml:id="ref_16885">right: straight, rigid.</note> lines of necessity, and sideways in its motions <ref target="#MDch47Note1"><hi rend="bold">directed</hi> by free will</ref><note xml:id="MDch47Note1">REVISION NARRATIVE: <hi rend="bold">directed</hi> by free will // Probably Melville, not an editor, revised “directed” to “modified” for the British edition. In Ishmael’s extended weaving metaphor, necessity is the warp or fixed vertical threads, which only move (vibrate) when they are separated by the traversing shuttle (in this case, Ishmael’s hand), which carries the woof, or thread, of free will; Queequeg’s wooden sword of chance unevenly tamps down the woof into the warp. But at the same time, Ishmael concludes, necessity and free will limit the effect of chance just as warp and woof provide the restraints and conditions by which Queequeg’s sword must be applied. To some extent, then, free will “directs” chance in that it gives direction to chance events. However, Melville may have felt that ”directed” overstates the power of free will, allowing the will to seem to control chance. By revising so that chance is merely “modified by free will,” Melville lessens the will’s controlling power. The NN editors adopted Melville’s revision as the “more appropriate word” (790); however, in keeping with its principal of not mixing versions but registering the revision in annotation, MEL makes no change.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees was that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly forward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries. To be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of whalemen’s look-outs perched as high in the air; but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indian’s.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries announcing their coming.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Instantly all was commotion.

Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows.

One of the men selected for shipkeepers—that is, those not appointed to the boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head.

So look the long line of man-of-war’s men about to throw themselves on board an enemy’s ship.
