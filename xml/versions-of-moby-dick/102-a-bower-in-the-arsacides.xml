<note xml:id="ref_18414">Arsacides: Part of the Solomon Islands, near the Philippines. Inhabitants of the Solomons resisted European incursion so fiercely that in 1769 the French navigator Jean François de Surville named the islands “Terre des Arsacides” (“land of the assassins”) after an ancient dynasty in the Near East. Ishmael’s non-eurocentric depiction of life on “Tranque” (actually the name of a little-known Chilean island) contradicts that reputation.</note> 

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">HITHERTO, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features. But to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him, it behoves me now to unbutton him still further, and untagging the <ref target="#ref_18408">points of his hose</ref><note xml:id="ref_18408">points of his hose: laces of his stockings.</note>, unbuckling his garters, and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones, set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say, in his unconditional skeleton.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale? Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a specimen rib for exhibition? Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a full-grown whale on your deck for examination, as a cook dishes a roast-pig? Surely not. A veritable witness have you hitherto been, <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1518930541493-b8g0wyn61r-5b17f40ee5c7082ebbe1f223c1a5f9f0%2FMD_Amer_0536.jpg"/>Ishmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone; the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams; the rafters, ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings, making up the frame-work of leviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats, dairy-rooms, butteries, and cheeseries in his bowels.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged to, a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his <ref target="#ref_18409">poke or bag</ref><note xml:id="ref_18409">poke or bag: stomach.</note>, to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons, and for the heads of the lances. Think you I let that chance go, without using my boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and <ref target="#ref_18415">breaking the seal</ref><note xml:id="ref_18415">breaking the seal: Of a letter sealed with wax, revealing something previously secret, as with the book having “seven seals” in Revelation 5.</note> and reading all the contents of that young cub?

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am indebted to my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides. For being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the trading-ship <ref target="#ref_21952">Dey of <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:389" type="place">Algiers</name></ref><note xml:id="ref_21952">when attached to the trading-ship Dey of Algiers: Because the Dey (ruler) protected piracy, thus supporting the kidnapping and enslavement of sailors, the vessel’s name is unlikely in reality but may point ironically to contempo-rary American slavery and the repression of seamen, about which Melville had written in Redburn and White-Jacket. He himself had shipped on one merchant vessel, the St. Lawrence, in 1839.</note>, I was invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque, at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side glen not very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his capital.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted with a devout love for all matters of <ref target="#ref_18410">barbaric vertù</ref><note xml:id="ref_18410">vertù: art objects and curios. </note>, had brought together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices, chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes; and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders, the wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-<pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1518930547100-bjpen3o28zq-5b17f40ee5c7082ebbe1f223c1a5f9f0%2FMD_Amer_0537.jpg"/>like, tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet. When the vast body had at last been stripped of its fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry in the sun, then the skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen, where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebræ were carved with Arsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head again sent forth its vapory spout; while, suspended from a bough, the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like <ref target="#ref_18417">the hair-hung sword that so affrighted <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:435" type="person"><name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:1091" type="artwork">Damocles</name></name></ref><note xml:id="ref_18417">the hair-hung sword that so affrighted Damocles: In his Tusculan Disputations, the Roman orator and writer Marcus Tullius Cicero (106–43 BCE) tells of the tyrant Dionysius the Elder of Syracuse, Italy, who teaches his courtier Damocles a lesson about the precariousness of life for those in power, by seating him at a banquet under a sword hanging by a single thread.</note>.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the <ref target="#ref_18418"><name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:390" type="place">Icy Glen</name></ref><note xml:id="ref_18418">Icy Glen: Not far from Melville’s home, “Arrowhead,” near Pittsfield, MA, this cold, mossy grotto near Stockbridge was on the itinerary of a social occasion at which Melville met Hawthorne on August 5, 1850. It is also mentioned in Pierre.</note>; the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the industrious earth beneath was as a weaver’s loom, with a gorgeous carpet on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and woof, and the living flowers the figures. All the trees, with all their laden branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the message-carrying air; all these unceasingly were active. Through the lacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!—pause!—one word!—whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all these ceaseless toilings? Speak, weaver!—stay thy hand!—but one single word with thee! Nay—the shuttle flies—the figures float from forth the loom; the <ref target="#ref_18411">freshet-rushing carpet</ref><note xml:id="ref_18411">freshet-rushing carpet: images in the carpet flow like a suddenly flooding stream.</note> for ever slides away. The weaver-god, he weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal voice; and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened; and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it. For even so it is in all material factories. The spoken words that are inaudible among the flying spindles; those same words are plainly heard without the walls, bursting from the opened casements. Thereby have villanies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in all <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1518930551621-6bfr4obck97-5b17f40ee5c7082ebbe1f223c1a5f9f0%2FMD_Amer_0538.jpg"/>this din of the great world’s loom, thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging—a gigantic idler! Yet, as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven over with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but himself a skeleton. Life folded Death; Death trellised Life; the grim god wived with youthful Life, and begat him curly-headed glories.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertù. He laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced before this skeleton—brushed the vines aside—broke through the ribs—and with a <ref target="#ref_18419">ball of Arsacidean twine</ref><note xml:id="ref_18419">ball of Arsacidean twine: Third use of the myth of the Cretan Labyrinth, previously found in Chs. 4 and 85.</note>, wandered, eddied long amid its many winding, shaded colonnades and arbors. But soon my line was out; and following it back, I emerged from the opening where I entered. I saw no living thing within; naught was there but bones.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the skeleton. From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib. “How now!” they shouted; “Dar’st thou measure this our god! That’s for us.” “Aye, priests—well, how long do ye make him, then?” But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them, concerning feet and inches; they cracked each other’s <ref target="#ref_18412">sconces</ref><note xml:id="ref_18412">sconces: heads (slang).</note> with their yard-sticks—the great skull echoed—and seizing that lucky chance, I quickly concluded my own admeasurements.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">These admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be it recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied measurement I please. Because there are skeleton <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1518930560873-rykdkqytnd-5b17f40ee5c7082ebbe1f223c1a5f9f0%2FMD_Amer_0539.jpg"/>authorities you can refer to, to test my accuracy. There is a <ref target="#ref_21968">Leviathanic Museum</ref><note xml:id="ref_21968">Leviathanic Museum . . . in Hull . . . Manchester . . . Burton Constable . . . skeleton of a Sperm Whale: According to Mansfield and Vincent (808–809), Melville drew on Beale for most of the British information on whale skeletons. The skeleton in Manchester, also mentioned by Thoreau, has disappeared. Burton Constable is an aristocratic house located at Hull, but Sir Clifford’s plans are Melville’s playful invention, suggesting the practices of New York showman P. T. Barnum. See also Making Moby-Dick.</note>, they tell me, in Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that country, where they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales. Likewise, I have heard that in the museum of Manchester, in New Hampshire, they have what the proprietors call “the only perfect specimen of a Greenland or River Whale in the United States.” Moreover, at a place in Yorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but of moderate size, by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo’s.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds. King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir Clifford, because he was lord of the <ref target="#ref_18413">seignories</ref><note xml:id="ref_18413">seignories: feudal domains.</note> of those parts. Sir Clifford’s whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a great chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony cavities—spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan—and swing all day upon his lower jaw. Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and shutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side. Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column; threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics. But as I was crowded for space, and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then composing—at least, what untattooed parts might remain—I did not trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.</p></div></body>
