THE SPHYNX

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">IT should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the body of the leviathan, he was beheaded. Now, the beheading of the Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves: and not without reason.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck; on the contrary, where his <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:1103" type="artwork">head and body</name> seem to join, there, in that very place, is the thickest part of him. Remember, also, that the surgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject, and that subject almost hidden in a discolored, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea. Bear in mind, too, that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh; and in that subterraneous manner, without so much as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus made, he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts, and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull. Do you not marvel, then, at Stubb’s boast, that he demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale?

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1514504429645-trlz5etmy8-959877ebdabb609459b56ae0737c70d8%2FMD_Amer_0383.jpg"/>by a cable till the body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a full grown leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale’s head embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to suspend such a burden as that, even by the <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/artwork:1096" type="artwork">immense tackles</name> of a whaler, this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a <ref target="#ref_17467">Dutch barn</ref><note xml:id="ref_17467">Dutch barn: The barns of Dutch American farmers, who had a reputation for careful husbandry, would presumably be heavy with produce. Melville, a New Yorker of Dutch descent, might have had in mind the literary embodiment of such a barn and such a farmer in <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:248">Irving, Washington, 1783-1859 	</ref>’s well-known story “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” (1820).</note> in jewellers’ scales.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The Pequod’s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head was hoisted against the ship’s side—about half way out of the sea, so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element. And there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves; there, that blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod’s waist like the <ref target="#ref_22015">giant Holofernes’s</ref><note xml:id="ref_22015">like the giant Holofernes’s from the girdle of Judith: In the story told in the apocryphal book of Judith, Holofernes, the Assyrian general besieging the Hebrew city <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:519">Bethulia</ref>, is a giant only in power. The pretty widow Judith charms her way into the enemy camp and the general’s tent, gets him drunk, and cuts off his head with his sword. In the many works of art based on the story, Holofernes is sometimes depicted as a giant, perhaps to magnify Judith’s bravery by analogy to David and Goliath. No known painting or etching depicts the scene as described here; perhaps Melville misremembered one that shows Judith holding the head by the hair, at the level of her waist, such as by Christoforo Allori (1615) or Peter Paul Rubens (1620–22).</note> from the girdle of Judith.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">When this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went below to their dinner. Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck. An intense <ref target="#ref_22016">copper calm</ref><note xml:id="ref_22016">copper calm, like a universal yellow lotus: “Copper” is common in meteorological descriptions, and the noontime copper calm enveloping the Pequod also echoes Samuel Taylor Coleridge's <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/text:220">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</ref>: “All in a hot and copper sky/ The bloody sun at noon,/ Right up above the mast did stand.” The lotus flower, a symbol of the sun common to Buddhist, Hindu, and ancient Egyptian beliefs, signifies universal enlightenment and is an ironic introduction to Ahab’s ensuing dark address to the whale’s head.</note>, like a universal yellow lotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">A short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone from his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarterdeck, he paused to gaze over the side, then slowly getting into the <ref target="#ref_20759">main-chains</ref><note xml:id="ref_20759">main-chains: "CHAINS, properly CHAIN-WALES, or CHANNELS. Broad and thick planks projecting horizontally from the ship's outside, to which they are fayed and bolted, abreast of and somewhat behind the masts. They are formed to project the chain-plate, and give the lower rigging greater out-rig or spread, free from the top-sides of the ship, thus affording greater security and support to the masts, as well as to prevent the shrouds from damaging the gunwale, or being hurt by rubbing against it. Of
course they are respectively designated fore, main, and mizzen. . . . 'In the chains' applies to the

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm, it seemed the <ref target="#ref_22017">Sphynx’s</ref><note xml:id="ref_22017">the Sphynx’s in the desert: The Egyptian Sphinx here is conflated with the one in Greek myth, whose riddle was the curse of Thebes until Oedipus solved it, bringing about her death and Theban liberation.

Of all divers, thou hast dived the deepest. That head upon which the upper sun now gleams, has moved amid this world’s foundations. Where unrecorded names and navies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned; there, in that awful water-land, there was thy most familiar home. Thou hast been where <ref target="#ref_17465">bell</ref><note xml:id="ref_17465">bell: device holding air, used for underwater work and observation.</note> or diver never went; hast slept by many a sailor’s side, where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down. Thou saw’st the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave; true to each other, when heaven seemed false to them. Thou saw’st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck; for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the <ref target="#ref_17466">insatiate maw</ref><note xml:id="ref_17466">insatiate maw: ever-hungry mouth (of the sea).</note>; and his murderers still sailed on unharmed—while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Sail ho!” cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Aye? Well, now, that’s cheering,” cried Ahab, suddenly erecting himself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow. “That lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better man.—Where away?”

Similarly, all things material and spiritual have their symbolic equivalent (or duplicate) in the mind. While Ahab can articulate these views, he cannot himself discover the links and duplicates of nature, soul, and mind; nor is the symbolic dead whale’s head divulging the secret.</note>, and O soul of man! how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not the smallest atom stirs or lives in matter, but has its cunning duplicate in mind.”</p></div></body>
