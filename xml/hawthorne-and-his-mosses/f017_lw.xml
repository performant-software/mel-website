                <p>given, in certain cases) even <lb/>from some Englishmen, than from their own
                    <lb/>countrymen. There are hardly five critics in<lb/> America; and several of
                    them are asleep. As<lb/> for patronage, it is the American author who <lb/>now
                    patronizes his country, and not his country<lb/> him. And if at times some among
                    them appeal <lb/>to the people for more recognition, it is not <lb/>always with
                    selfish motives, but patriotic ones.</p>
                <p>It is true, that but few of them as yet have <lb/>evinced that decided
                    originality which merits<lb/> great praise. But that graceful writer, who
                    <lb/>perhaps of all Americans has received the most<lb/> plaudits from his own
                    country for his produc-<lb/>tions,--that very popular and amiable writer,<lb/>
                    however good, and self-reliant in many things,<lb/> perhaps owes his chief
                    reputation to the self-<lb/>acknowledged imitation of a foreign model, and
                    <lb/>to the studied avoidance of all topics but<lb/> smooth ones. But it is
                    better to fail in origin-<lb/>ality, than to succeed in imitation. He who
                    <lb/>has never failed somewhere, that man cannot<lb/> be great. Failure is the
                    true test of greatness<lb/>. And if it be said, that continual success is a
                    <lb/>proof that a man wisely knows his powers,--<lb/>it is only to be added,
                    that, in that case, he <lb/>knows them to be small. Let us believe it,
                    <lb/>then, once for all, that there is no hope for us <lb/>in these smooth
                    pleasing writers that know<lb/> their powers. Without malice, but to speak<lb/>
                    the plain fact, they but furnish an appendix <lb/>to Goldsmith, and other
                    English authors. And <lb/>we want no American Goldsmiths; nay, we <lb/>want no
                    American Miltons. </p>
