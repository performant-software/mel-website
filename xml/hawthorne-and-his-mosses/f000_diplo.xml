				<head>By a Virginian Spending July in Vermont</head>
				<p>A papered chamber in a fine<lb/> old farm-house -- a mile from any other dwelling,<lb/> and dipped to the eaves in foliage -- surrounded by<lb/> mountains, old woods, and Indian ponds, -- this, surely, is<lb/> the place to write of Hawthorne. Some charm is in<lb/> this northern air, for love and duty seem both impelling<lb/> to the task. A man of a deep &amp; noble nature has seized<lb/> me in this seclusion. His wild, witch voice rings thro' me;<lb/> or, in softer cadences, I seem to hear it in the songs of<lb/> the hill-side birds, that sing in the larch trees at my<lb/> window.</p>
				<p>Would that all excellent books were foundlings,<lb/> without father or mother, that so it might be, we<lb/> could glorify them, without including their <metamark>^</metamark><add change="ms1" facs="#f000_z001" hand="#hm" place="above" rend="caret">ostensible</add> authors. Nor<lb/> would any true man take exception to this; -- least of all,<lb/> he who writes, -- <ref target="note_95c7b9ada4214c3ba8fa892d5ef3bb20" type="editorial">"When the Artist rises high enough to<lb/> achieve the Beautiful, the symbol by which he makes it<lb/> perceptible to mortal senses becomes of little value in his<lb/> eyes, while his spirit possesses itself in the enjoyment<lb/> of the reality."</ref><note type="editorial" xml:id="note_95c7b9ada4214c3ba8fa892d5ef3bb20">HM did not mark this passage in his copy of Mosses from an Old Manse. This is the final line from "The Artist of the Beautiful, on which Melville left marginalia on four pages. Melville mistakenly capitalized "artist" and switched tenses in copying the sentence -- "When the artist rose enough to achieve the Beautiful, the symbol by which he made it perceptible to mortal senses became of little value in his eyes, while his spirit possessed itself in the enjoyment of the reality" (p. 191 in HM's 1846 Wiley &amp; Putnam edition).</note></p>
