                <p>altogether tell. Cer-<lb/>tain it is, however, that this great power of<lb/>
                    blackness in him derives its force from its ap-<lb/>peals to that Calvinistic
                    sense of Innate De-<lb/>pravity and Original Sin, from whose visita-<lb/>tions,
                    in some shape or other, no deeply think-<lb/>ing mind is always and wholly free.
                    For, in<lb/> certain moods, no man can weigh this world<lb/> without throwing in
                    something, somehow like<lb/> Original Sin, to strike the uneven balance.<lb/> At
                    all events, perhaps no writer has ever<lb/> wielded this terrific thought with
                    greater terror<lb/> than this same harmless Hawthorne. Still<lb/> more: this
                    black conceit pervades him through<cb/> and through. You may be witched by his
                    sun-<lb/>light,-- transported by the bright gildings in<lb/> the skies he builds
                    over you; but there is the<lb/> blackness of darkness beyond; and even his<lb/>
                    bright gildings but fringe and play upon the<lb/> edges of thunder-clouds. In
                    one word, the<lb/> world is mistaken in this Nathaniel Haw-<lb/>thorne. He
                    himself must often have smiled<lb/> at its absurd misconception of him. He
                    is<lb/> immeasurably deeper than the plummet of the<lb/> mere critic. For it is
                    not the brain that can<lb/> test such a man; it is only the heart. You<lb/>
                    cannot come to know greatness by inspecting<lb/> it; there is no glimpse to be
                    caught of it,<lb/> except by intuition; you need not ring it, you<lb/> but touch
                    it, and you find it is gold</p>
                <p> Now it is that blackness in Hawthorne, of<lb/> which I have spoken, that so
                    fixes and fasci-<lb/>nates me. It may be, nevertheless, that it is<lb/> too </p>
