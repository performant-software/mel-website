                    kindness the more beautiful and<lb/> touching. It was so sweet of him, being
                    en-<lb/>dowed with such power, to dwell, day after<lb/> day, and one long,
                    lonesome night after an-<lb/>other, on the dusky hearth, only now and then<lb/>
                    betraying his wild nature, by thrusting his red<lb/> tongue out of the
                    chimney-top! True, he had<lb/> done much mischief in the world, and was<lb/>
                    pretty certain to do more, but his warm heart<lb/> atoned for all. He was kindly

                <p>But he has still other apples, not quite so<lb/> ruddy, though full as ripe;--

                    boyhood prefigured his<lb/> abortive prime, which, likewise, contained<lb/>
                    within itself the prophecy and image of his<lb/> lean and torpid age." Such
                    touches as are in<lb/> this piece can not proceed from any common<lb/> heart.
                    They argue such a depth of tender-<lb/>ness, such a boundless sympathy with
                    all<lb/> forms of being, such an omnipresent love, that<lb/> we must needs say
