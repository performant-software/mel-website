                <p>subse-<lb/>quently fancying to himself some ideal image <lb/>of the man and his
                    mind. And if you rightly <lb/>look for it, you will almost always find that
                    <lb/>the author himself has somewhere furnished <lb/>you with his own picture.
                    <lb/>For poets (whether <lb/>in prose or verse), being painters of <lb/>nature,
                    are like their brethren of the pencil, the true <lb/>portrait-painters, who, in
                    the multitude of like-<lb/>nesses to be sketched, do not invariably omit
                    <lb/>their own; and in all high instances, they paint <lb/>them without any
                    vanity, though at times <lb/>with a lurking something, that would take
                    <lb/>several pages to properly define.</p>
                <p>I submit it, then, to those best acquainted <lb/>with the man personally, whether
                    the follow-<lb/>ing is not Nathaniel Hawthorne;--and to him-<lb/>self, whether
                    something involved in it does not <lb/>express the temper of his mind,--that
                    lasting <lb/>temper of all true, candid men--a seeker, not <lb/>a finder yet:--
                    <lb/>
                </p>
                <p>"A man now entered, in neglected attire, with <lb/>the aspect of a thinker, but
                    somewhat too rough-<lb/>hewn and brawny for a scholar. His face was <lb/>full of sturdy
                    vigor, with some finer and keener <lb/>attribute beneath; though harsh at first, it
                    was <lb/>tempered with the glow of a large, warm heart, <cb/>which had force enough to
                    heat his powerful intel-<lb/>lect through and through. He advanced to the
                    <lb/>Intelligencer, and looked at him with a glance of <lb/>such stern sincerity, that
                    perhaps few secrets were <lb/>beyond its scope.</p>
                <p>"'I seek for Truth,' said he."</p>

                <p>Twenty-four hours have elapsed since <lb/>writing the foregoing. I have just returned
                    <lb/>from the hay-mow, charged more and more <lb/>with love and admiration of Hawthorne.
                    For <lb/>I have just been gleaning through the Mosses, <lb/>picking up many things here
                    and there that had <lb/>previously escaped me. And I found that but <lb/>to glean after
                    this man, </p>
