               <note type="compositorial">Alexander</note>Stretched on that new mown clover, <lb/> the hill-side breeze blowing over me <lb/>
               <hi rend="bold">thro'</hi> the wide barn door, and soothed by the hum of the <lb/> bees in the meadows around, how magically <lb/> stole over me this <hi rend="bold">Mossy</hi>
               <hi rend="bold">Man</hi>! And how amply, <lb/> how bountifully, did he redeem that delicious <lb/> promise to his guests in the Old Manse, of whom <lb/> it is written -- "Others could give them pleasure, <lb/> "<hi rend="bold">or</hi> amusement, or instruction -- these could be <lb/> "picked up anywhere -- but it was for me to <lb/> "give them rest.

What <lb/> "better could be done for  weary and <lb/> "world-worn spirits? what better could be done <lb/> "for anybody, who came within our magic <lb/> "circle, than to throw the spell of a magic spirit <lb/> "over him?" -- So all that day, <hi rend="bold">half-</hi>buried in the <lb/> new clover , I watched this Hawthorne's <lb/> "Assyrian dawn, and Paphian sunset and moon-<lb/> rise, from the summit of our Eastern Hill."</p>

            <p>What a mild moonlight of contemplative <lb/>humor bathes that Old Manse!-- the rich and <lb/> rare distilment of a spicy and slowly-oozing heart.<lb/> No rollicking <hi rend="bold">rudeness,</hi> no gross fun fed on fat dinners, <lb/> and bred in the lees of wine,-- but a humor <lb/> so spiritually gentle, so high, so deep, and yet</p>
