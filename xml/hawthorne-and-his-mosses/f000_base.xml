				<head>Hawthorne &amp; His Mosses,</head>
				<head>By a Virginian Spending July in Vermont</head>
				<p>A papered chamber in a fine<lb/> old farm-house -- a mile from any other dwelling,<lb/> and dipped to the eaves in foliage -- surrounded by<lb/> mountains, old woods, and Indian ponds, -- this, surely, is<lb/> the place to write of Hawthorne. Some charm is in<lb/> this northern air, for love and duty seem both impelling<lb/> to the task. A man of a deep &amp; noble nature has seized<lb/> me in this seclusion. His wild, witch voice rings thro' me;<lb/> or, in softer cadences, I seem to hear it in the songs of<lb/> the hill-side birds, that sing in the larch trees at my<lb/> window.</p>
				<p>Would that all excellent books were foundlings,<lb/> without father or mother, that so it might be, we<lb/> could glorify them, without including their ostensible authors. Nor<lb/> would any true man take exception to this; -- least of all,<lb/> he who writes, -- "When the Artist rises high enough to<lb/> achieve the Beautiful, the symbol by which he makes it<lb/> perceptible to mortal senses becomes of little value in his<lb/> eyes, while his spirit possesses itself in the enjoyment<lb/> of the reality."</p>
				<p>But more than this. I know not</p>
