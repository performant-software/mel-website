                <p>time led by <lb/>ourselves--us Americans. Let us boldly con-<lb/>temn all
                    imitation, though it comes to us <lb/>graceful and fragrant as the morning; and
                    <lb/>foster all originality, <lb/>though, at first, it be crabbed and ugly as
                    our own pine knots. <lb/>And if any of our authors fail, or seem to fail,
                    <lb/>then, in the words of my Carolina cousin, let <lb/>us clap him
                    on the shoulder, and back him <lb/>against all Europe for his second round. The
                    <lb/>truth is, that in one point of view, this matter <lb/>of a national
                    literature has come to such a pass <lb/>with us, that in some sense we must turn
                    bul-<cb/>lies, else the day is lost, or superiority so far <lb/>beyond us, that
                    we can hardly say it will ever <lb/>be ours.</p>
                <p>And now, my countrymen, as an excellent <lb/>author, of your own flesh and
                    blood,--an un-<lb/>imitating, and, perhaps, in his way, an inimi-<lb/>table
                    man--whom better can I commend to <lb/>you, in the first place, than Nathaniel
                    Haw-<lb/>thorne. He is one of the new, and far better <lb/>generation of your
                    writers. The smell of <lb/>your beeches and hemlocks is upon him; your o<lb/>wn
                    broad praries are in his soul; and if you <lb/>travel away inland into his deep
                    and noble <lb/>nature, you will hear the far roar of his <lb/>Niagara. Give not
                    over to future generations <lb/>the glad duty of acknowledging him for what
                    <lb/>he is. Take that joy to your self, in your own <lb/>generation; and so
                    shall he feel those grateful <lb/>impulses in him, that may possibly prompt
                    <lb/>him to the full flower of some still greater <lb/>achievement in your
                    eyes.</p>
