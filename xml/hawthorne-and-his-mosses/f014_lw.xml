                <p>Now, I do not say that Nathaniel of Salem is <lb/> a greater than William of
                    Avon, or as great.<lb/> But the difference between the two men is by<lb/> no
                    means immeasurable. Not a very great<lb/> deal more, and Nathaniel were verily
                    William.</p>
                <p>This, too, I mean, that if Shakspeare has <lb/>not been equalled, give the world
                    time, and <lb/>he is sure to be surpassed, in one hemisphere or<lb/>the other.
                    Nor will it at all do to say, that the <lb/>world is getting grey and grizzled
                    now, and<lb/> has lost that fresh charm which she wore of <lb/>old, and by
                    virtue of which the great poets of <lb/>past times made themselves what we
                    esteem<lb/> them to be. Not so. The world is as young<lb/> to-day, as when it
                    was created; and this Ver-<lb/>mont morning dew is as wet to my feet, as
                    <lb/>Eden's dew to Adam's. Nor has Nature been<lb/> all over ransacked by our
                    progenitors, so that<lb/> no new charms and mysteries remain for this<lb/>
                    latter generation to find. Far from it. The <lb/>trillionth part has not yet
                    been said; and all<lb/> that has been said, but multiplies the avenues <lb/>to
                    what remains to be said. It is not so much<lb/> paucity as superabundance of
                    material that <lb/>seems to incapacitate modern authors. </p>
