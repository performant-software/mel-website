                <p>By some people, this entire scrawl of mine may <lb/>be esteemed altogether
                    unnecessary, inasmuch, <lb/>"as years ago" (they may say) "we found out <lb/>the
                    rich and rare stuff in this Hawthorne, <lb/>whom you now parade forth, as if
                    only <hi rend="italics">your-<lb/>self</hi> were the discoverer of this
                    Portuguese dia-<lb/>mond in our literature." But even granting <lb/>all this--
                    and adding to it, the assumption that <lb/>the books of Hawthorne have sold by
                    the five <lb/>thousand,--what does that signify? They <lb/>should be sold by the
                    hundred thousand; and <lb/>read by the million; and admired by every one
                    <lb/>who is capable of admiration.</p>
