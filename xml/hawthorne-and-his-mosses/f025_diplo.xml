				<p>And here, let me throw out another conceit of<lb/> mine touching this American Shiloh, or "Master Genius,"<lb/> as Hawthorne calls him. May it not be, that this<lb/> commanding mind has not been, is not, and never will<lb/> be, individually developed in any one man? And would<lb/> it, indeed, appear so unreasonable to suppose, that this<lb/> great fullness and overflowing may be, or may be destined<lb/> to be, shared by a plurality of men of genius? Surely, to<lb/> take the very greatest example on record, Shakespeare cannot<lb/> be regarded as in himself the concretion of all the genius<lb/> of his time; nor as so immeasurably beyond Marlow, Webster,<lb/> Ford, Beaumont, Jonson, that <corr change="#StB" facs="#f025_z003">those </corr>great men can be<lb/> said to share none of his<metamark change="#StB" facs="#f025_z002" function="caret" place="inline">caret with guideline</metamark> <del change="#StB" facs="#f025_z000" hand="#HM" rend="single-stroke">genius. </del><add change="#StB" facs="#f025_z001" hand="#HM" place="above" rend="caret">power?</add> For one, I conceive <lb/>that there were dramatists in Elizabeth's day, between<lb/> whom and Shakespeare the distance was by no means great.
