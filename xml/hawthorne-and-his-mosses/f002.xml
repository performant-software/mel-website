			<p>unpopular merit, that amid the thick stir of <lb/> other things, the hint of my tasteful friend was <lb/> disregarded; and for four years the Mosses on <lb/> the old Manse never refreshed me with their <lb/> perennial green. <del facs="iiifmossesmanifest.json#f002_delete-but">But</del> It may be, ^<add change="metadata#StB" facs="iiifmossesmanifest.json#f002_add-however" hand="metadata#HM">however,</add> that all this <lb/> while, the book, like wine, was only improving in <lb/> flavor and body. At any rate, it so chanced <lb/> that this long procrastination eventuated in a happy <lb/> result. At breakfast the other day, a mountain <lb/> girl, a cousin of mine, who for the last two weeks <lb/> has every morning helped me to strawberries and <lb/> raspberries,--which, <del facs="iiifmossesmanifest.json#f002_delete-like">like</del> ^<add change="metadata#StB" facs="iiifmossesmanifest.json#f002_add-the" hand="metadata#HM">the</add> roses and pearls in the fairy tale, <lb/> seemed to fall into the saucer from those strawberry- <lb/> beds her cheeks,--this delightful creature, this charming <lb/> Cherry says to me-- "I see you spend your mornings <lb/> in the hay-mow; and yesterday I found there 'Dwight's <lb/> Travels in New England'.
