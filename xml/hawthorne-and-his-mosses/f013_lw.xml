                <p>not <lb/>Shakspeare, but only Master William Shak-<lb/>speare of the shrewd, thriving,
                    business firm <lb/>of Condell, Shakspeare & Co., proprietors of the <lb/>Globe Theatre in
                    London; and by a courtly <lb/>author, of the name of Chettle, was looked at<lb/>
                    as an "upstart crow," beautified "with other <lb/>birds' feathers." For, mark it well,
                    imitation <lb/>is often the first charge brought against real <lb/>originality. Why this
                    is so, there is not space <pb/>to set forth here. You must have plenty of <lb/>sea-room to
                    tell the Truth in; especially <lb/>when it seems to have an aspect of newness,
                    <lb/>as America did in 1492, though it was then <lb/>just as old, and perhaps older than Asia, only <lb/>those sagacious philosophers, the common <lb/>sailors, had never seen it before, swearing it <lb/>was all water and moonshine there.</p>
