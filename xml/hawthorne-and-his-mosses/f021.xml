			<quote><p>I submit it, then, to those best<lb/> acquainted with the man personally, whether<lb/> the following is not Nathaniel Hawthorne,-<lb/>and to himself, whether something involved in<lb/> it does not express the temper of this mind,<lb/>-that lasting temper of all true, candid men<lb/>-a seeker, not a finder yet:-</p>

He advanced to the Intelligencer, and<lb/> looked at him with a glance of such stern sincerity, that<lb/> perhaps few secrets were beyond its scope.</p>
