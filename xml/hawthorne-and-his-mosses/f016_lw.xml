                <p>Let America then prize and cherish her <lb/> writers; yea, let her glorify them.
                    They are<lb/> not so many in number as to exhaust her<lb/> good-will. And while
                    she has good kith and<lb/> kin of her own, to take to her bosom, let her<lb/>
                    not lavish her embraces upon the household of<lb/> an alien. For believe it or
                    not, England, after<lb/> all, is, in many things an alien to us. China<lb/> has
                    more bonds of real love for us than she.<lb/> But even were there no strong
                    literary indivi-<lb/>dualities among us, as there are some dozens at<lb/> least,
                    nevertless, let America first <note>[Rest of the paragraph inserted from f015]</note>praise <lb/>mediocrity even, in her own children, before
                    <lb/>she praises (for everywhere, merit demands <lb/>acknowledgment from every
                    one) the best<lb/> excellence in the children of any other land. <lb/>Let her
                    own authors, I say, have the pri-<lb/>ority of appreciation. I was much pleased
                    <lb/>with a hot-headed Carolina cousin of mine,<lb/> who once said,--"If there
                    were no other<lb/> American to stand by, in literature, why, then, <lb/>I would
                    stand by Pop Emmons and his "Fre-<lb/>doniad," and till a better epic came
                    along, <lb/>swear it was not very far behind the Iliad." <lb/>Take away the
                    words, and in spirit he was <lb/>sound.</p>
                <p>Not that American genius needs patronage<lb/> in order to expand. For that
                    explosive sort o<lb/>f stuff will expand though screwed up in a <lb/>vice, and
                    burst it, though it were triple steel.<lb/> It is for the nation's sake, and not
                    for her<lb/> authors' sake, that I would have America be<lb/> heedful of the
                    increasing greatness among her<pb/> writers. For how great the shame,<lb/> if
                    other nations should be before her, in crowning her<lb/> heroes of the pen! But
                    this is almost the case <lb/>now. American authors have received more<lb/> just
                    and discriminating praise (however loftily<lb/> and ridiculously</p>
