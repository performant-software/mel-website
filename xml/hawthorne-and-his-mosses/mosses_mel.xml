				<head>Hawthorne &amp; His Mosses,</head>
				<head>By a Virginian Spending July in Vermont</head>
				<head>Part I</head>
				<p>A papered chamber in a fine<lb/> old farm-house -- a mile from any other dwelling,<lb/> and dipped to the eaves in foliage -- surrounded by<lb/> mountains, old woods, and Indian ponds, -- this, surely, is<lb/> the place to write of Hawthorne. Some charm is in<lb/> this northern air, for love and duty seem both impelling<lb/> to the task. A man of a deep &amp; noble nature has seized<lb/> me in this seclusion. His wild, witch voice rings thro' me;<lb/> or, in softer cadences, I seem to hear it in the songs of<lb/> the hill-side birds, that sing in the larch trees at my<lb/> window.</p>
				<p>Would that all excellent books were foundlings,<lb/> without father or mother, that so it might be, we<lb/> could glorify them, without including their ostensible authors. Nor<lb/> would any true man take exception to this; -- least of all,<lb/> he who writes, -- <ref target="note_9f762d8685424b2e8380ea53d69940e4" type="editorial">"When the Artist rises high enough to<lb/> achieve the Beautiful, the symbol by which he makes it<lb/> perceptible to mortal senses becomes of little value in his<lb/> eyes, while his spirit possesses itself in the enjoyment<lb/> of the reality."</ref><note xml:id="note_9f762d8685424b2e8380ea53d69940e4">HM did not mark this passage in his copy of Mosses from an Old Manse. This is the final line from "The Artist of the Beautiful, on which Melville left marginalia on four pages. Melville mistakenly capitalized "artist" and switched tenses in copying the sentence -- "When the artist rose enough to achieve the Beautiful, the symbol by which he made it perceptible to mortal senses became of little value in his eyes, while his spirit possessed itself in the enjoyment of the reality" (p. 191 in HM's 1846 Wiley &amp; Putnam edition).</note></p>
				<p>But more than this. I know not</p>

				<p>what would be the right name to put on the<lb/> title-page of an excellent book, but this I feel, that <lb/>the names of all fine authors are fictitious ones, far <lb/>more so than that of Junius-- simply standing, as they do, for the <lb/> mystical, ever-eluding Spirit of all Beauty, which <lb/> ubiquitously possesses  men of genius. Purely <reg>imaginative</reg>
					<orig>imagina<lb/> tive</orig> as this fancy may appear, it nevertheless seems to <lb/> receive some warrantry from the fact, that on a personal <lb/> interview no great author has ever come up to the <lb/> idea of his reader. But that dust of which our <lb/> bodies are composed, how can it fitly express <lb/> the nobler intelligences among us? With reverence be <lb/> it spoken, that not even in the case of one deemed <lb/> more than man, not even in our Saviour, did his <lb/>
					visible frame betoken anything of the augustness of the nature within. <lb/> Else, how could those Jewish eyewitnesses fail to <lb/> see heaven in his glance.</p>
				<p> It is curious, how a man may travel <lb/> along a country road, and yet miss the grandest, <lb/> or sweetest of prospects, by reason of an intervening <lb/> hedge,  so like all other hedges, as in no way <lb/> to hint of the  wide landscape beyond.<lb/> So  has it been with me concerning the enchanting <lb/> landscape in the soul of this Hawthorne, this most <lb/> excellent Man of Mosses. His "Old Manse" has been <lb/> written now four years, but I never read it till a day or two since.<lb/>. I had seen it in the book-stores -- <lb/> heard of it often -- even had it recommended to me <lb/> by a tasteful friend, as a rare, quiet book, perhaps <lb/> too deserving of popularity to be popular. But there are <lb/> so many books called "excellent," and so much</p>
			</div>
			
			<div type="leaf" n="3">
				<pb facs="#f002"/>
				<p>unpopular merit, that amid the thick stir of <lb/> other things, the hint of my tasteful friend was <lb/> disregarded; and for four years the Mosses on <lb/> the old Manse never refreshed me with their <lb/> perennial green. It may be, however, that all this <lb/> while, the book, like wine, was only improving in <lb/> flavor and body. At any rate, it so chanced <lb/> that this long procrastination eventuated in a happy <lb/> result. At breakfast the other day, a mountain <lb/> girl, a cousin of mine, who for the last two weeks <lb/> has every morning helped me to strawberries and <lb/> raspberries,-- which, likethe roses and pearls in the fairy tale, <lb/> seemed to fall into the saucer from those strawberry- <lb/> beds her cheeks,-- this delightful creature, this charming <lb/> Cherry says to me -- "I see you spend your mornings <lb/> in the hay-mow; and yesterday I found there '"Dwight's <lb/> Travels in New England'". Now I have something far <lb/> better than that,--something more congenial to our <lb/> summer on these hills. Take these raspberries, and <lb/> then I will give you some moss." -- "Moss"! said I. -- "Yes, <lb/> and you must take it to the barn with you, and <lb/> good-bye to 'Dwight' ". [With that she left me,<lb/> and soon returned with a volume, verdantly <lb/> bound, and garnished with a curious frontispiece in <lb/> green,-- nothing less, than a fragment of real moss <lb/> cunningly pressed to a fly-leaf. -- "Why this," said I <lb/> spilling my raspberries, "this is the 'Mosses from an <lb/> Old Manse'." "Yes" said cousin Cherry "yes, it is that flowery <lb/> Hawthorne." --</p>
				<p>-- "Hawthorne and Mosses" said I "no more: <lb/> it is morning: it is July in the country: and I</p>

				<p>am off for the barn".</p>
				<p>
					<note type="compositorial">Alexander</note>Stretched on that new mown clover, <lb/> the hill-side breeze blowing over me <lb/>
					<hi rend="bold">thro'</hi> the wide barn door, and soothed by the hum of the <lb/> bees in the meadows around, how magically <lb/> stole over me this <hi rend="bold">Mossy</hi>
					<hi rend="bold">Man</hi>! And how amply, <lb/> how bountifully, did he redeem that delicious <lb/> promise to his guests in the Old Manse, of whom <lb/> it is written -- "Others could give them pleasure, <lb/> "<hi rend="bold">or</hi> amusement, or instruction -- these could be <lb/> "picked up anywhere -- but it was for me to <lb/> "give them rest. Rest, in a life of trouble! What <lb/> "better could be done for  weary and <lb/> "world-worn spirits? what better could be done <lb/> "for anybody, who came within our magic <lb/> "circle, than to throw the spell of a magic spirit <lb/> "over him?" -- So all that day, <hi rend="bold">half-</hi>buried in the <lb/> new clover , I watched this Hawthorne's <lb/> "Assyrian dawn, and Paphian sunset and moon-<lb/> rise, from the summit of our Eastern Hill."</p>
				<p>The soft ravishments of the man spun me round <lb/> about in a web of dreams, and when the book was <lb/> closed, when the spell was over, this wizard <lb/> "dismissed me with but misty reminiscences, as if <lb/> I had been dreaming of him"</p>
				<p>What a mild moonlight of contemplative <lb/>humor bathes that Old Manse!-- the rich and <lb/> rare distilment of a spicy and slowly-oozing heart.<lb/> No rollicking <hi rend="bold">rudeness,</hi> no gross fun fed on fat dinners, <lb/> and bred in the lees of wine,-- but a humor <lb/> so spiritually gentle, so high, so deep, and yet</p>

				<p>But it is the least part of genius <lb/> that attracts admiration. Where Hawthorne is <lb/> known, he seems to be <hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">deemed</hi> a pleasant <lb/> writer, with a pleasant style, -- a sequestered, <lb/> harmless man, from whom any deep and <lb/> weighty thing would <hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">hardly be anticipated: --</hi>
					<hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">a man who means no meanings.</hi>
					<lb/> But there is no man, in <hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">whom</hi> humor and love, <lb/> like mountain peaks, soar to such a rapt height, <lb/> as to receive the irradiations of the upper <lb/> skies; --  there is no man in <lb/> whom humor &amp; love are developed in that <lb/> high form called genius; no such man can exist <lb/> without also possessing, as the <hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">indispensable complement </hi>
					<lb/> of <hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">these,</hi> a great, deep intellect, which drops down <lb/> into <hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">the</hi> universe like a <hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">plummet</hi>. <hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">Or, love</hi> and humor <lb/>are only the eyes, through which such an intellect <lb/> views this world.

					<lb/>of thinkers. For by philosophers Shakespeare is <lb/>not <hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">adored</hi> as the great man of tragedy and <lb/>comedy.--"Off with his head! so much for <lb/>Buckingham!" this sort of rant, <hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">interlined</hi>

But it is those deep <lb/>
					<hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">far-away</hi> things in him; those occasional flashings-forth of <lb/>the intuitive Truth in him; those short, <lb/>quick probings <hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">at</hi> the very axis of reality:-- these <lb/>are the things that make Shakespeare, Shakes-<lb/>peare.

					<hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">much of the blind, unbridled</hi> admiration that has been heaped <lb/>upon Shakespeare, has been lavished upon the <lb/> least part of him.

				<p>But unlike Shakespeare, who was forced <lb/>to <hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">the contrary course</hi> by circumstances, Hawthorne <hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">(</hi>either from <lb/>simple disinclination, or else from inaptitude) <lb/>refrains from all the <hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">popularizing noise</hi> and show of <lb/>broad farce, <hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">&amp;</hi> blood-besmeared tragedy; <lb/>content with the still, rich utterance<hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">s</hi> of a <lb/>great intellect in repose, and which sends <lb/>few thoughts into circulation, except they be <lb/>arterialized <hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">at</hi> his large warm lungs, and <lb/>expanded in his honest heart.</p> 
				<p>Nor need you <lb/>fix upon that blackness in him, if it suit <lb/>you not. Nor, indeed, will all readers discern <lb/>it, for it is, <hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">mostly,</hi>
					<hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">insinuated</hi> to those who may <lb/>best undersand it, and account for it; it is <lb/>not obtruded upon every one alike.</p>
				<p>     Some may start to read of Shakespeare and <lb/>Hawthorne on the same page. They may say, that if <lb/>an illustration were needed, a lesser light might have <lb/>sufficed to elucidate this Hawthorne, this <hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">small</hi> man of <lb/>yesterday. But I am not, willingly, one of those, who, <lb/>as touching Shakespeare at least, exemplify the <lb/>maxim of Rochefoucault, that "we exalt the reputation <lb/>of some, in order to depress that of others"<hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">;--</hi> who, to <lb/>teach all <hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold"> noble-souled aspirants</hi> that there is no hope for them, <lb/>pronounce Shakespeare absolutely unapproachable. <lb/>

					<hi xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="bold">Shakespeare</hi> has been approached.

				<p>for the sake of any one man, whoever he <lb/>may be. This is too cheap a purchase of contentment <lb/>for conscious mediocrity to make.
