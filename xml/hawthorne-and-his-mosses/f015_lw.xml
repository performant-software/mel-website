                <p> praise <lb/>mediocrity even, in her own children, before <lb/>she praises (for everywhere,
                    merit demands <lb/>acknowledgment from every one) the best<lb/> excellence in the children
                    of any other land. <lb/>Let her own authors, I say, have the pri-<lb/>ority of
                    appreciation. I was much pleased <lb/>with a hot-headed Carolina cousin of mine,<lb/> who
                    once said,--"If there were no other<lb/> American to stand by, in literature, why,
                    then, <lb/>I would stand by Pop Emmons and his "Fre-<lb/>doniad," and till a better epic
                    came along, <lb/>swear it was not very far behind the Iliad." <lb/>Take away the words,
                    and in spirit he was <lb/>sound.</p>
