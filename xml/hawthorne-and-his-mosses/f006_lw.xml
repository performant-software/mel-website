                <p>little way into the intricate, profound heart<lb/> where they originated. And we
                    see, that<lb/> suffering, some time or other and in some shape<lb/> or other,--
                    this only can enable any man to<lb/> depict it in others. All over him,
                    Hawthorne's<pb/> melancholy rests like an Indian Summer,<lb/> which, though
                    bathing a whole country in one<lb/> softness, still reveals the distinctive hue
                    of<lb/> every towering hill, and each far-winding vale.</p>
                <p>But it is the least part of genius that attracts<lb/> admiration. Where Hawthorne
                    is known, he<lb/> seems to be deemed a pleasant writer, with a<lb/> pleasant
                    style, --a sequestered, harmless man,<lb/> from whom any deep and weighty thing
                    would<lb/> hardly be anticipated--a man who means no<lb/> meanings. But there is
                    no man, in whom<lb/> humor and love, like mountain peaks, soar to<lb/> such a
                    rapt height, as to receive the irradiations<lb/> of the upper skies; --there is
                    no man in<lb/> whom humor and love are developed in that<lb/> high form called
                    genius; no such man can<lb/> exist without also possessing, as the
                    indis-<lb/>pensable complement of these, a great, deep<lb/> intellect, which
                    drops down into the universe<lb/> like a plummet. Or, love and humor are
                    only<lb/> the eyes, through which such an intellect<lb/> views this world. The
                    great beauty in such a<lb/> mind is but the product of its strength.<lb/> What,
                    to all readers, can be more charming<lb/> than the piece entitled "Monsieur du
                    Miroir;"<lb/> and to a reader at all capable of fully fathom-<lb/>ing it, what,
                    at the same time, can possess<lb/> more mystical depth of meaning?--yes,
                    there<lb/> he sits, and looks at me,--this "shape of mys-<lb/>tery," this
                    "identical Monsieur du Miroir."<lb/></p>
