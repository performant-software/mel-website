                <p>what would be <lb/> the right name to put on the title-page of<lb/> an excellent
                    book; but this I feel, that the <lb/>names of all fine authors are fictitious
                    ones,<lb/> far more so than that of Junius; simply stand-<lb/>ing, as they do,
                    for the mystical, ever-eluding<lb/> spirit of all beauty, which ubiquitously
                    pos-<lb/>sesses men of genius. Purely imaginative as<lb/> this fancy may appear,
                    it nevertheless seems to<lb/> receive some warranty from the fact, that on<lb/>
                    a personal interview no great author has ever<lb/> come up to the idea of his
                    reader. But that<lb/> dust of which our bodies are composed, how <lb/> can it
                    fitly express the nobler intelligences<lb/> among us? With reverence be it
                    spoken, that<lb/> not even in the case of one deemed more than<lb/> man, not
                    even in our Saviour, did his visible<lb/> frame betoken anything of the
                    augustness of <lb/>the nature within. Else, how could those<lb/> Jewish
                    eyewitnesses fail to see heaven in his glance!</p>
                <p> It is curious, how a man may travel along a<lb/> country road, and yet miss the
                    grandest, or<lb/> sweetest of prospects by reason of an inter-<lb/>vening hedge,
                    so like all other hedges, as in<lb/> no way to hint of the wide landscape
                    beyond.<lb/> So has it been with me concerning the en-<lb/>chanting landscape in
                    the soul of this Haw-<lb/>thorne, this most excellent Man of Mosses.<cb/> His
                    "Old Manse" has been written now four<lb/> years, but I never read it till a day
                    or two<lb/> since. I had seen it in the book-stores--heard<lb/> of it
                    often--even had it recommended to me<lb/> by a tasteful friend, as a rare, quiet
                    book, per-<lb/>haps too deserving of popularity to be popu-<lb/>lar. But there
                    are so many books called "ex-<lb/>cellent," and so much</p>
