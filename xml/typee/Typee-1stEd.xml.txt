<head>PREFACE.</head>
<ornament type="line"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">More</hi> than three years have elapsed since the occurrence of the <lb/>
events recorded in this volume. The interval, with the exception <lb/>
of the last few months, has been chiefly spent by the author tossing <lb/>
about on the wide ocean. Sailors are the only class of men who <lb/>
now-a-days see anything like stirring adventure; and many things <lb/>
which to fire-side people appear strange and romantic, to them <lb/>
seem as common-place as a jacket out at elbows. Yet, <reg orig="notwith-|standing">notwithstanding</reg> <lb/>
the familiarity of sailors with all sorts of curious <reg orig="ad-|venture">adventure</reg>, <lb/>
the incidents recorded in the following pages have <lb/>
often served, when "spun as a yarn," not only to relieve the <lb/>
weariness of many a night-watch at sea, but to excite the warmest <lb/>
sympathies of the author's shipmates. He has been therefore <lb/>
led to think that his story could scarcely fail to interest those <lb/>
who are less familiar than the sailor with a life of adventure.</p>
<p>In his account of the singular and interesting people among <lb/>
whom he was thrown, it will be observed that he chiefly treats <lb/>
of their more obvious peculiarities; and, in describing their <reg orig="cus-|toms">customs</reg>, <lb/>
refrains in most cases from entering into explanations <reg orig="con-|cerning">concerning</reg> <lb/>
their origin and purposes. As writers of travels among <lb/>
barbarous communities are generally very diffuse on these <reg orig="sub-|jects">subjects</reg>, <lb/>
he deems it right to advert to what may be considered a <lb/>
culpable omission. No one can be more sensible than the author <lb/>
of his deficiencies in this and many other respects; but when the <lb/>
<pb n="viii" entity="z000000574_0019" pid="uva-lib:244471"/>
very peculiar circumstances in which he was placed are <reg orig="under-|stood">understood</reg>, <lb/>
he feels assured that all these omissions will be excused.</p>
<p>In very many published narratives no little degree of attention <lb/>
is bestowed upon dates; but as the author lost all knowledge of <lb/>
the days of the week, during the occurrence of the scenes herein <lb/>
related, he hopes that the reader will charitably pass over his <lb/>
shortcomings in this particular.</p>
<p>In the Polynesian words used in this volume&mdash;except in those <lb/>
cases where the spelling has been previously determined by <lb/>
others&mdash;that form of orthography has been employed, which <lb/>
might be supposed most easily to convey their sound to a <lb/>
stranger. In several works descriptive of the islands in the <lb/>
Pacific, many of the most beautiful combinations of vocal sounds <lb/>
have been altogether lost to the ear of the reader by an <reg orig="over-|attention">over-attention</reg> <lb/>
to the ordinary rules of spelling.</p>
<p>There are a few passages in the ensuing chapters which may <lb/>
be thought to bear rather hard upon a reverend order of men, <lb/>
the account of whose proceedings in different quarters of the <lb/>
globe&mdash;transmitted to us through their own hands&mdash;very <reg orig="ge-|nerally">generally</reg>, <lb/>
and often very deservedly, receives high commendation. <lb/>
Such passages will be found, however, to be based upon facts <lb/>
admitting of no contradiction, and which have come immediately <lb/>
under the writer's cognizance. The conclusions deduced from <lb/>
these facts are unavoidable, and in stating them the author has <lb/>
been influenced by no feeling of animosity, either to the <reg orig="indi-|viduals">individuals</reg> <lb/>
themselves or to that glorious cause which has not <lb/>
always been served by the proceedings of some of its advocates.</p>
<p>The great interest with which the important events lately <lb/>
occurring at the Sandwich, Marquesas, and Society Islands, have <lb/>
been regarded in America and England, and indeed throughout <lb/>
the world, will, he trusts, justify a few otherwise unwarrantable <lb/>
digressions.</p>
<pb n="ix" entity="z000000574_0020" pid="uva-lib:244472"/>
<p>There are some things related in the narrative which will be <lb/>
sure to appear strange, or perhaps entirely incomprehensible, <lb/>
to the reader; but they cannot appear more so to him than they <lb/>
did to the author at the time. He has stated such matters just <lb/>
as they occurred, and leaves every one to form his own opinion <lb/>
concerning them; trusting that his anxious desire to speak the <lb/>
unvarnished truth will gain for him the confidence of his <lb/>
readers.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Six</hi> months at sea! Yes, reader, as I live, six months out of <lb/>
sight of land; cruising after the sperm-whale beneath the <lb/>
scorching sun of the Line, and tossed on the billows of the <reg orig="wide-|rolling">wide-rolling</reg> <lb/>
Pacific&mdash;the sky above, the sea around, and nothing else! <lb/>
Weeks and weeks ago our fresh provisions were all exhausted. <lb/>
There is not a sweet potatoe left; not a single yam. Those <lb/>
glorious bunches of banannas which once decorated our stern <lb/>
and quarter-deck have, alas, disappeared! and the delicious <lb/>
oranges which hung suspended from our tops and stays&mdash;they, <lb/>
too, are gone! Yes, they are all departed, and there is nothing <lb/>
left us but salt-horse and sea-biscuit. Oh! ye state-room sailors, <lb/>
who make so much ado about a fourteen-days' passage across the <lb/>
Atlantic; who so pathetically relate the privations and hardships <lb/>
of the sea, where, after a day of breakfasting, lunching, dining <lb/>
off five courses, chatting, playing whist, and drinking <reg orig="champaign-|punch">champaignpunch</reg>, <lb/>
it was your hard lot to be shut up in little cabinets of <lb/>
mahogany and maple, and sleep for ten hours, with nothing to <lb/>
disturb you but "those good-for-nothing tars, shouting and <lb/>
tramping over head,"&mdash;what would ye say to our six months out <lb/>
of sight of land?</p>
<p>Oh! for a refreshing glimpse of one blade of grass&mdash;for a snuff <lb/>
at the fragrance of a handful of the loamy earth! Is there <lb/>
nothing fresh around us? Is there no green thing to be seen? <lb/>
Yes, the inside of our bulwarks is painted green; but what a <lb/>
<pb n="2" entity="z000000574_0029" pid="uva-lib:244481"/>
vile and sickly hue it is, as if nothing bearing even the semblance <lb/>
of verdure could flourish this weary way from land. Even the <lb/>
bark that once clung to the wood we use for fuel has been <lb/>
gnawed off and devoured by the captain's pig; and so long ago, <lb/>
too, that the pig himself has in turn been devoured.</p>
<p>There is but one solitary tenant in the chicken-coop, once a <lb/>
gay and dapper young cock, bearing him so bravely among the <lb/>
coy hens. But look at him now; there he stands, moping all <lb/>
the day long on that everlasting one leg of his. He turns with <lb/>
disgust from the mouldy corn before him, and the brackish water <lb/>
in his little trough. He mourns no doubt his lost companions, <lb/>
literally snatched from him one by one, and never seen again. <lb/>
But his days of mourning will be few; for Mungo, our black <lb/>
cook, told me yesterday that the word had at last gone forth, <lb/>
and poor Pedro's fate was sealed. His attenuated body will be <lb/>
laid out upon the captain's table next Sunday, and long before <lb/>
night will be buried with all the usual ceremonies beneath that <lb/>
worthy individual's vest. Who would believe that there could <lb/>
be any one so cruel as to long for the decapitation of the <reg orig="luck-|less">luckless</reg> <lb/>
Pedro; yet the sailors pray every minute, selfish fellows, <lb/>
that the miserable fowl may be brought to his end. They say <lb/>
the captain will never point the ship for the land so long as he <lb/>
has in anticipation a mess of fresh meat. This unhappy bird can <lb/>
alone furnish it; and when he is once devoured, the captain will <lb/>
come to his senses. I wish thee no harm, Peter; but as thou art <lb/>
doomed, sooner or later, to meet the fate of all thy race; and if <lb/>
putting a period to thy existence is to be the signal for our <reg orig="deli-|verance">deliverance</reg>, <lb/>
why&mdash;truth to speak&mdash;I wish thy throat cut this very <lb/>
moment; for, oh! how I wish to see the living earth again! <lb/>
The old ship herself longs to look out upon the land from her <lb/>
hawse-holes once more, and Jack Lewis said right the other day <lb/>
when the captain found fault with his steering.</p>
<p>"Why, d'ye see, Captain Vangs," says bold Jack, "I'm as <lb/>
good a helmsman as ever put hand to spoke; but none of us can <lb/>
steer the old lady now. We can't keep her full and bye, sir: <lb/>
watch her ever so close, she will fall off; and then, sir, when I <lb/>
put the helm down so gently, and try like to coax her to the <lb/>
work, she won't take it kindly, but will fall round off again; <lb/>
and it's all because she knows the land is under the lee, sir, and <lb/>
<pb n="3" entity="z000000574_0030" pid="uva-lib:244482"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">B 2</fw></pb>
she wont go any more to windward." Aye, and why should she, <lb/>
Jack? didn't every one of her stout timbers grow on shore, and <lb/>
hasn't she sensibilities as well as we?</p>
<p>Poor old ship! Her very looks denote her desires: how <reg orig="de-|plorably">deplorably</reg> <lb/>
she appears! The paint on her sides, burnt up by the <lb/>
scorching sun, is puffed out and cracked. See the weeds she <lb/>
trails along with her, and what an unsightly bunch of those <lb/>
horrid barnacles has formed about her stern-piece; and every <lb/>
time she rises on a sea, she shows her copper torn away, or <lb/>
hanging in jagged strips.</p>
<p>Poor old ship! I say again: for six months she has been <reg orig="roll-|ing">rolling</reg> <lb/>
and pitching about, never for one moment at rest. But <lb/>
courage, old lass, I hope to see thee soon within a biscuit's toss <lb/>
of the merry land, riding snugly at anchor in some green cove, <lb/>
and sheltered from the boisterous winds.</p>

<p>"Hurra, my lads! It's a settled thing; next week we shape <lb/>
our course to the Marquesas!" The Marquesas! What strange <lb/>
visions of outlandish things does the very name spirit up! <lb/>
Naked houris&mdash;cannibal banquets&mdash;groves of cocoa-nut&mdash;coral <lb/>
reefs &mdash; tatooed chiefs &mdash; and bamboo temples; sunny valleys <lb/>
planted with bread-fruit-trees&mdash;carved canoes dancing on the <lb/>
flashing blue waters&mdash;savage woodlands guarded by horrible <lb/>
idols&mdash;<hi rend="italic">heathenish rites and human sacrifices.</hi></p>
<p>Such were the strangely jumbled anticipations that haunted <lb/>
me during our passage from the cruising ground. I felt an <reg orig="irre-|sistible">irresistible</reg> <lb/>
curiosity to see those islands which the olden voyagers <lb/>
had so glowingly described.</p>
<p>The group for which we were now steering (although among <lb/>
the earliest of European discoveries in the South Seas, having <lb/>
been first visited in the year 1595) still continues to be tenanted <lb/>
by beings as strange and barbarous as ever. The missionaries, <lb/>
sent on a heavenly errand, had sailed by their lovely shores, and <lb/>
had abandoned them to their idols of wood and stone. How <reg orig="in-|teresting">interesting</reg> <lb/>
the circumstances under which they were discovered! <lb/>
In the watery path of Mendanna, cruising in quest of some <lb/>
region of gold, these isles had sprung up like a scene of <reg orig="enchant-|ment">enchantment</reg>, <lb/>
and for a moment the Spaniard believed his bright dream <lb/>
was realised. In honour of the Marquess de Mendoza, then <lb/>
<pb n="4" entity="z000000574_0031" pid="uva-lib:244483"/>
viceroy of Peru&mdash;under whose auspices the navigator sailed&mdash; <lb/>
he bestowed upon them the name which denoted the rank of his <lb/>
patron, and gave to the world on his return a vague and <reg orig="magni-|ficent">magnificent</reg> <lb/>
account of their beauty. But these islands, undisturbed <lb/>
for years, relapsed into their previous obscurity; and it is only <lb/>
recently that anything has been known concerning them. Once <lb/>
in the course of a half century, to be sure, some adventurous <lb/>
rover would break in upon their peaceful repose, and, astonished <lb/>
at the unusual scene, would be almost tempted to claim the merit <lb/>
of a new discovery.</p>
<p>Of this interesting group, but little account has ever been <lb/>
given, if we except the slight mention made of them in the <lb/>
sketches of South-Sea voyages. Cook, in his repeated <reg orig="circum-|navigations">circumnavigations</reg> <lb/>
of the globe, barely touched at their shores; and all <lb/>
that we know about them is from a few general narratives. <lb/>
Among these, there are two that claim particular notice. <lb/>
Porter's `Journal of the Cruise of the U. S. frigate Essex, in the <lb/>
Pacific, during the late War,' is said to contain some interesting <lb/>
particulars concerning the islanders. This is a work, however, <lb/>
which I have never happened to meet with; and Stewart, the <lb/>
chaplain of the American sloop of war Vincennes, has likewise <lb/>
devoted a portion of his book, entitled `A Visit to the South <lb/>
Seas,' to the same subject.</p>
<p>Within the last few years American and English vessels <lb/>
engaged in the extensive whale fisheries of the Pacific have <lb/>
occasionally, when short of provisions, put into the commodious <lb/>
harbour which there is in one of the islands; but a fear of the <lb/>
natives, founded on a recollection of the dreadful fate which <lb/>
many white men have received at their hands, has deterred their <lb/>
crews from intermixing with the population sufficiently to gain <lb/>
any insight into their peculiar customs and manners.</p>
<p>The Protestant Missions appear to have despaired of <reg orig="reclaim-|ing">reclaiming</reg> <lb/>
these islands from heathenism. The usage they have in <lb/>
every case received from the natives has been such as to <reg orig="intimi-|date">intimidate</reg> <lb/>
the boldest of their number. Ellis, in his `Polynesian <lb/>
Researches,' gives some interesting accounts of the abortive <lb/>
attempts made by the Tahiti Mission to establish a branch <lb/>
Mission upon certain islands of the group. A short time before <lb/>
my visit to the Marquesas, a somewhat amusing incident took <lb/>
<pb n="5" entity="z000000574_0032" pid="uva-lib:244484"/>
place in connection with these efforts, which I cannot avoid <lb/>
relating.</p>
<p>An intrepid missionary, undaunted by the ill-success that had <lb/>
attended all previous endeavours to conciliate the savages, and <lb/>
believing much in the efficacy of female influence, introduced <lb/>
among them his young and beautiful wife, the first white woman <lb/>
who had ever visited their shores. The islanders at first gazed <lb/>
in mute admiration at so unusual a prodigy, and seemed inclined <lb/>
to regard it as some new divinity. But after a short time, <reg orig="be-|coming">becoming</reg> <lb/>
familiar with its charming aspect, and jealous of the <lb/>
folds which encircled its form, they sought to pierce the sacred <lb/>
veil of calico in which it was enshrined, and in the gratification <lb/>
of their curiosity so far overstepped the limits of good breeding, <lb/>
as deeply to offend the lady's sense of decorum. Her sex once <lb/>
ascertained, their idolatry was changed into contempt; and there <lb/>
was no end to the contumely showered upon her by the savages, <lb/>
who were exasperated at the deception which they conceived <lb/>
had been practised upon them. To the horror of her <reg orig="affec-|tionate">affectionate</reg> <lb/>
spouse, she was stripped of her garments, and given to <lb/>
understand that she could no longer carry on her deceits with <lb/>
impunity. The gentle dame was not sufficiently evangelised to <lb/>
endure this, and, fearful of further improprieties, she forced her <lb/>
husband to relinquish his undertaking, and together they <reg orig="re-|turned">returned</reg> <lb/>
to Tahiti.</p>
<p>Not thus shy of exhibiting her charms was the Island Queen <lb/>
herself, the beauteous wife of Mowanna, the king of Nukuheva. <lb/>
Between two and three years after the adventures recorded in <lb/>
this volume, I chanced, while aboard of a man-of-war, to touch <lb/>
at these islands. The French had then held possession of the <lb/>
Marquesas some time, and already prided themselves upon the <lb/>
beneficial effects of their jurisdiction, as discernible in the <reg orig="de-|portment">deportment</reg> <lb/>
of the natives. To be sure, in one of their efforts at <lb/>
reform they had slaughtered about a hundred and fifty of them <lb/>
at Whitihoo&mdash;but let that pass. At the time I mention, the <lb/>
French squadron was rendezvousing in the bay of Nukuheva, <lb/>
and during an interview between one of their captains and our <lb/>
worthy Commodore, it was suggested by the former, that we, as <lb/>
the flag-ship of the American squadron, should receive, in state, <lb/>
a visit from the royal pair. The French officer likewise <reg orig="repre-|sented">represented</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="6" entity="z000000574_0033" pid="uva-lib:244485"/>
with evident satisfaction, that under their tuition the <lb/>
king and queen had imbibed proper notions of their elevated <lb/>
station, and on all ceremonious occasions conducted themselves <lb/>
with suitable dignity. Accordingly, preparations were made to <lb/>
give their majesties a reception on board in a style corresponding <lb/>
with their rank.</p>
<p>One bright afternoon, a gig, gaily bedizened with streamers, <lb/>
was observed to shove off from the side of one of the French <lb/>
frigates, and pull directly for our gangway. In the stern sheets <lb/>
reclined Mowanna and his consort. As they approached, we <lb/>
paid them all the honours due to royalty;&mdash;manning our yards, <lb/>
firing a salute, and making a prodigious hubbub.</p>
<p>They ascended the accommodation ladder, were greeted by <lb/>
the Commodore, hat in hand, and passing along the <reg orig="quarter-|deck">quarterdeck</reg>, <lb/>
the marine guard presented arms, while the band struck <lb/>
up `The king of the Cannibal Islands.' So far all went well. <lb/>
The French officers grimaced and smiled in exceedingly high <lb/>
spirits, wonderfully pleased with the discreet manner in which <lb/>
these distinguished personages behaved themselves.</p>
<p>Their appearance was certainly calculated to produce an <lb/>
effect. His majesty was arrayed in a magnificent military <reg orig="uni-|form">uniform</reg>, <lb/>
stiff with gold lace and embroidery, while his shaven <lb/>
crown was concealed by a huge chapeau bras, waving with <reg orig="os-|trich">ostrich</reg> <lb/>
plumes. There was one slight blemish, however, in his <lb/>
appearance. A broad patch of tatooing stretched completely <lb/>
across his face, in a line with his eyes, making him look as if he <lb/>
wore a huge pair of goggles; and royalty in goggles suggested <lb/>
some ludicrous ideas. But it was in the adornment of the fair <lb/>
person of his dark-complexioned spouse that the tailors of the <lb/>
fleet had evinced the gaiety of their national taste. She was <lb/>
habited in a gaudy tissue of scarlet cloth, trimmed with yellow <lb/>
silk, which, descending a little below the knees, exposed to view <lb/>
her bare legs, embellished with spiral tatooing, and somewhat <lb/>
resembling two miniature Trajan's columns. Upon her head <lb/>
was a fanciful turban of purple velvet, figured with silver sprigs, <lb/>
and surmounted by a tuft of variegated feathers.</p>
<p>The ship's company crowding into the gangway to view the <lb/>
sight, soon arrested her majesty's attention. She singled out <lb/>
from their number an old <hi rend="italic">salt,</hi> whose bare arms and feet, and <lb/>
<pb n="7" entity="z000000574_0034" pid="uva-lib:244486"/>
exposed breast were covered with as many inscriptions in India <lb/>
ink as the lid of an Egyptian sarcophagus. Notwithstanding <lb/>
all the sly hints and remonstrances of the French officers, she <lb/>
immediately approached the man, and pulling further open the <lb/>
bosom of his duck frock, and rolling up the leg of his wide <reg orig="trow-|sers">trowsers</reg>, <lb/>
she gazed with admiration at the bright blue and vermilion <lb/>
pricking, thus disclosed to view. She hung over the fellow, <lb/>
caressing him, and expressing her delight in a variety of wild <lb/>
exclamations and gestures. The embarrassment of the polite <lb/>
Gauls at such an unlooked-for occurrence may be easily <reg orig="ima-|gined">imagined</reg>; <lb/>
but picture their consternation, when all at once the <lb/>
royal lady, eager to display the hieroglyphics on her own sweet <lb/>
form, bent forward for a moment, and turning sharply round, <lb/>
threw up the skirts of her mantle, and revealed a sight from <lb/>
which the aghast Frenchmen retreated precipitately, and <reg orig="tum-|bling">tumbling</reg> <lb/>
into their boat, fled the scene of so shocking a catastrophe.</p>

</argument>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I can</hi> never forget the eighteen or twenty days during which <lb/>
the light trade-winds were silently sweeping us towards the <lb/>
islands. In pursuit of the sperm whale, we had been cruizing <lb/>
on the line some twenty degrees to the westward of the <reg orig="Galli-|pagos">Gallipagos</reg>; <lb/>
and all that we had to do, when our course was <reg orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg> <lb/>
on, was to square in the yards and keep the vessel before <lb/>
the breeze, and then the good ship and the steady gale did the <lb/>
rest between them. The man at the wheel never vexed the old <lb/>
lady with any superfluous steering, but comfortably adjusting his <lb/>
limbs at the tiller, would doze away by the hour. True to her <lb/>
work, the Dolly headed to her course, and like one of those <reg orig="cha-|racters">characters</reg> <lb/>
who always do best when let alone, she jogged on her way <lb/>
like a veteran old sea-pacer as she was.</p>
<p>What a delightful, lazy, languid time we had whilst we were <lb/>
thus gliding along! There was nothing to be done; a <reg orig="circum-|stance">circumstance</reg> <lb/>
that happily suited our disinclination to do anything. We <lb/>
abandoned the fore-peak altogether, and spreading an awning <lb/>
over the forecastle, slept, ate, and lounged under it the live-long <lb/>
day. Every one seemed to be under the influence of some <reg orig="nar-|cotic">narcotic</reg>. <lb/>
Even the officers aft, whose duty required them never to <lb/>
be seated while keeping a deck watch, vainly endeavoured to <lb/>
keep on their pins; and were obliged invariably to compromise <lb/>
the matter by leaning up against the bulwarks, and gazing <reg orig="ab-|stractedly">abstractedly</reg> <lb/>
over the side. Reading was out of the question; take <lb/>
a book in your hand, and you were asleep in an instant.</p>
<p>Although I could not avoid yielding in a great measure to the <lb/>
general languor, still at times I contrived to shake off the spell, <lb/>
<pb n="9" entity="z000000574_0036" pid="uva-lib:244488"/>
and to appreciate the beauty of the scene around me. The sky <lb/>
presented a clear expanse of the most delicate blue, except along <lb/>
the skirts of the horizon, where you might see a thin drapery of <lb/>
pale clouds which never varied their form or colour. The long, <lb/>
measured, dirge-like swell of the Pacific came rolling along, <lb/>
with its surface broken by little tiny waves, sparkling in the <lb/>
sunshine. Every now and then a shoal of flying fish, scared <lb/>
from the water under the bows, would leap into the air, and fall <lb/>
the next moment like a shower of silver into the sea. Then you <lb/>
would see the superb albicore, with his glittering sides, sailing <lb/>
aloft, and often describing an arc in his descent, disappear on <lb/>
the surface of the water. Far off, the lofty jet of the whale <lb/>
might be seen, and nearer at hand the prowling shark, that <lb/>
villainous footpad of the seas, would come skulking along, and, <lb/>
at a wary distance, regard us with his evil eye. At times, some <lb/>
shapeless monster of the deep, floating on the surface, would, as <lb/>
we approached, sink slowly into the blue waters, and fade away <lb/>
from the sight. But the most impressive feature of the scene <lb/>
was the almost unbroken silence that reigned over sky and water. <lb/>
Scarcely a sound could be heard but the occasional breathing of <lb/>
the grampus, and the rippling at the cut-water.</p>
<p>As we drew nearer the land, I hailed with delight the <reg orig="ap-|pearance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
of innumerable sea-fowl. Screaming and whirling in <lb/>
spiral tracks, they would accompany the vessel, and at times <lb/>
alight on our yards and stays. That piratical-looking fellow, <lb/>
appropriately named the man-of-war's hawk, with his blood-red <lb/>
bill and raven plumage, would come sweeping round us in <lb/>
gradually diminishing circles, till you could distinctly mark the <lb/>
strange flashings of his eye; and then, as if satisfied with his <lb/>
observation, would sail up into the air and disappear from the <lb/>
view. Soon, other evidences of our vicinity to the land were <lb/>
apparent, and it was not long before the glad announcement of <lb/>
its being in sight was heard from aloft,&mdash;given with that <reg orig="pecu-|liar">peculiar</reg> <lb/>
prolongation of sound that a sailor loves&mdash;"Land ho!"</p>
<p>The captain, darting on deck from the cabin, bawled lustily <lb/>
for his spy-glass; the mate in still louder accents hailed the <lb/>
mast-head with a tremendous "where-away?" The black cook <lb/>
thrust his woolly head from the galley, and Boatswain, the dog, <lb/>
leaped up between the knight-heads, and barked most furiously. <lb/>
<pb n="10" entity="z000000574_0037" pid="uva-lib:244489"/>
Land ho! Aye, there it was. A hardly perceptible blue <lb/>
irregular outline, indicating the bold contour of the lofty <lb/>
heights of Nukuheva.</p>
<p>This island, although generally called one of the Marquesas, <lb/>
is by some navigators considered as forming one of a distinct <lb/>
cluster, comprising the islands of Ruhooka, Ropo, and <reg orig="Nuku-|heva">Nukuheva</reg>; <lb/>
upon which three the appellation of the Washington <lb/>
Group has been bestowed. They form a triangle, and lie within <lb/>
the parallels of 8&deg; 38&Prime; and 9&deg; 32&Prime; South latitude, and 139&deg; 20&prime; <lb/>
and 140&deg; 10&prime; West longitude from Greenwich. With how little <lb/>
propriety they are to be regarded as forming a separate group <lb/>
will be at once apparent, when it is considered that they lie in <lb/>
the immediate vicinity of the other islands, that is to say, less <lb/>
than a degree to the north-west of them; that their inhabitants <lb/>
speak the Marquesan dialect, and that their laws, religion, and <lb/>
general customs are identical. The only reason why they were <lb/>
ever thus arbitrarily distinguished, may be attributed to the <lb/>
singular fact, that their existence was altogether unknown to <lb/>
the world until the year 1791, when they were discovered by <lb/>
Captain Ingraham, of Boston, Massachusetts, nearly two <reg orig="centu-|ries">centuries</reg> <lb/>
after the discovery of the adjacent islands by the agent of <lb/>
the Spanish Viceroy. Notwithstanding this, I shall follow the <lb/>
example of most voyagers, and treat of them as forming part and <lb/>
parcel of the Marquesas.</p>
<p>Nukuheva is the most important of these islands, being the <lb/>
only one at which ships are much in the habit of touching, and <lb/>
is celebrated as being the place where the adventurous Captain <lb/>
Porter refitted his ships during the late war between England <lb/>
and the United States, and whence he sallied out upon the large <lb/>
whaling fleet then sailing under the enemy's flag in the <reg orig="surround-|ing">surrounding</reg> <lb/>
seas. This island is about twenty miles in length and nearly <lb/>
as many in breadth. It has three good harbours on its coast; <lb/>
the largest and best of which is called by the people living in its <lb/>
vicinity `Tyohee,' and by Captain Porter was denominated <lb/>
Massachusetts Bay. Among the adverse tribes dwelling about <lb/>
the shores of the other bays, and by all voyagers, it is generally <lb/>
known by the name bestowed upon the island itself&mdash;Nukuheva. <lb/>
Its inhabitants have become somewhat corrupted, owing to their <lb/>
recent commerce with Europeans; but so far as regards their <lb/>
<pb n="11" entity="z000000574_0038" pid="uva-lib:244490"/>
peculiar customs and general mode of life, they retain their <lb/>
original primitive character, remaining very nearly in the same <lb/>
state of nature in which they were first beheld by white men. <lb/>
The hostile clans, residing in the more remote sections of the <lb/>
island, and very seldom holding any communication with <reg orig="fo-|reigners">foreigners</reg>, <lb/>
are in every respect unchanged from their earliest <lb/>
known condition.</p>
<p>In the bay of Nukuheva was the anchorage we desired to reach. <lb/>
We had perceived the loom of the mountains about sunset; so <lb/>
that after running all night with a very light breeze, we found <lb/>
ourselves close in with the island the next morning: but as the bay <lb/>
we sought lay on its farther side, we were obliged to sail some <lb/>
distance along the shore, catching, as we proceeded, short glimpses <lb/>
of blooming valleys, deep glens, waterfalls, and waving groves, <lb/>
hidden here and there by projecting and rocky headlands, every <lb/>
moment opening to the view some new and startling scene of <lb/>
beauty.</p>
<p>Those who for the first time visit the South Seas, generally <lb/>
are surprised at the appearance of the islands when beheld from <lb/>
the sea. From the vague accounts we sometimes have of their <lb/>
beauty, many people are apt to picture to themselves enamelled <lb/>
and softly swelling plains, shaded over with delicious groves, and <lb/>
watered by purling brooks, and the entire country but little <lb/>
elevated above the surrounding ocean. The reality is very <reg orig="dif-|ferent">different</reg>; <lb/>
bold rock-bound coasts, with the surf beating high <lb/>
against the lofty cliffs, and broken here and there into deep inlets, <lb/>
which open to the view thickly-wooded valleys, separated by the <lb/>
spurs of mountains clothed with tufted grass, and sweeping down <lb/>
towards the sea from an elevated and furrowed interior, form the <lb/>
principal features of these islands.</p>
<p>Towards noon we drew abreast the entrance to the harbour, <lb/>
and at last we slowly swept by the intervening promontory, and <lb/>
entered the bay of Nukuheva. No description can do justice to <lb/>
its beauty; but that beauty was lost to me then, and I saw <lb/>
nothing but the tri-coloured flag of France trailing over the stern <lb/>
of six vessels, whose black hulls and bristling broadsides <reg orig="pro-|claimed">proclaimed</reg> <lb/>
their warlike character. There they were, floating in <lb/>
that lovely bay, the green eminences of the shore looking down <lb/>
so tranquilly upon them, as if rebuking the sternness of their <lb/>
<pb n="12" entity="z000000574_0039" pid="uva-lib:244491"/>
aspect. To my eye nothing could be more out of keeping than <lb/>
the presence of these vessels; but we soon learnt what brought <lb/>
them there. The whole group of islands had just been taken <lb/>
possession of by Rear Admiral Du Petit Thouars, in the name of <lb/>
the invincible French nation.</p>
<p>This item of information was imparted to us by a most <reg orig="extra-|ordinary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
individual, a genuine South-Sea vagabond, who came <lb/>
alongside of us in a whale-boat as soon as we entered the bay, <lb/>
and by the aid of some benevolent persons at the gangway was <lb/>
assisted on board, for our visitor was in that interesting stage of <lb/>
intoxication when a man is amiable and helpless. Although he <lb/>
was utterly unable to stand erect or to navigate his body across <lb/>
the deck, he still magnanimously proffered his services to pilot <lb/>
the ship to a good and secure anchorage. Our captain, however, <lb/>
rather distrusted his ability in this respect, and refused to <reg orig="recog-|nise">recognise</reg> <lb/>
his claim to the character he assumed; but our gentleman <lb/>
was determined to play his part, for by dint of much scrambling <lb/>
he succeeded in getting into the weather-quarter boat, where he <lb/>
steadied himself by holding on to a shroud, and then commenced <lb/>
issuing his commands with amazing volubility and very peculiar <lb/>
gestures. Of course no one obeyed his orders; but as it was <reg orig="im-|possible">impossible</reg> <lb/>
to quiet him, we swept by the ships of the squadron with <lb/>
this strange fellow performing his antics in full view of all the <lb/>
French officers.</p>
<p>We afterwards learned that our eccentric friend had been a <lb/>
lieutenant in the English navy; but having disgraced his flag by <lb/>
some criminal conduct in one of the principal ports on the main, <lb/>
he had deserted his ship, and spent many years wandering among <lb/>
the islands of the Pacific, until accidentally being at Nukuheva <lb/>
when the French took possession of the place, he had been <reg orig="ap-|pointed">appointed</reg> <lb/>
pilot of the harbour by the newly constituted authorities.</p>
<p>As we slowly advanced up the bay, numerous canoes pushed <lb/>
off from the surrounding shores, and we were soon in the midst <lb/>
of quite a flotilla of them, their savage occupants struggling to <lb/>
get aboard of us, and jostling one another in their ineffectual <lb/>
attempts. Occasionally the projecting out-riggers of their slight <lb/>
shallops running foul of one another, would become entangled <lb/>
beneath the water, threatening to capsize the canoes, when a <lb/>
scene of confusion would ensue that baffles description. Such <lb/>
<pb n="13" entity="z000000574_0040" pid="uva-lib:244492"/>
strange outcries and passionate gesticulations I never certainly <lb/>
heard or saw before. You would have thought the islanders <lb/>
were on the point of flying at one another's throats, whereas they <lb/>
were only amicably engaged in disentangling their boats.</p>
<p>Scattered here and there among the canoes might be seen <lb/>
numbers of cocoa nuts floating closely together in circular <lb/>
groups, and bobbing up and down with every wave. By some <lb/>
inexplicable means these cocoa nuts were all steadily <reg orig="approach-|ing">approaching</reg> <lb/>
towards the ship. As I leaned curiously over the side <reg orig="en-|deavouring">endeavouring</reg> <lb/>
to solve their mysterious movements, one mass far in <lb/>
advance of the rest attracted my attention. In its centre was <lb/>
something I could take for nothing else than a cocoa nut, but <lb/>
which I certainly considered one of the most extraordinary <reg orig="spe-|cimens">specimens</reg> <lb/>
of the fruit I had ever seen. It kept twirling and dancing <lb/>
about among the rest in the most singular manner, and as it drew <lb/>
nearer I thought it bore a remarkable resemblance to the brown <lb/>
shaven skull of one of the savages. Presently it betrayed a pair <lb/>
of eyes, and soon I became aware that what I had supposed to <lb/>
have been one of the fruit was nothing else than the head of an <lb/>
islander, who had adopted this singular method of bringing his <lb/>
produce to market. The cocoa nuts were all attached to one <lb/>
another by strips of the husk, partly torn from the shell and <lb/>
rudely fastened together. Their proprietor inserting his head <lb/>
into the midst of them, impelled his necklace of cocoa nuts <lb/>
through the water by striking out beneath the surface with his <lb/>
feet.</p>
<p>I was somewhat astonished to perceive that among the number <lb/>
of natives that surrounded us not a single female was to be seen. <lb/>
At that time I was ignorant of the fact that by the operation of <lb/>
the "taboo" the use of canoes in all parts of the island is <reg orig="rigor-|ously">rigorously</reg> <lb/>
prohibited to the entire sex, for whom it is death even to <lb/>
be seen entering one when hauled on shore; consequently, <reg orig="when-|ever">whenever</reg> <lb/>
a Marquesan lady voyages by water, she puts in requisition <lb/>
the paddles of her own fair body.</p>
<p>We had approached within a mile and a half perhaps of the <lb/>
foot of the bay, when some of the islanders, who by this time had <lb/>
managed to scramble aboard of us at the risk of swamping their <lb/>
canoes, directed our attention to a singular commotion in the <lb/>
water ahead of the vessel. At first I imagined it to be produced <lb/>
<pb n="14" entity="z000000574_0041" pid="uva-lib:244493"/>
by a shoal of fish sporting on the surface, but our savage friends <lb/>
assured us that it was caused by a shoal of "whinhenies" (young <lb/>
girls), who in this manner were coming off from the shore to <lb/>
welcome us. As they drew nearer, and I watched the rising and <lb/>
sinking of their forms, and beheld the uplifted right arm bearing <lb/>
above the water the girdle of tappa, and their long dark hair <lb/>
trailing beside them as they swam, I almost fancied they could <lb/>
be nothing else than so many mermaids:&mdash;and very like <reg orig="mer-|maids">mermaids</reg> <lb/>
they behaved too.</p>
<p>We were still some distance from the beach, and under slow <lb/>
headway, when we sailed right into the midst of these swimming <lb/>
nymphs, and they boarded us at every quarter; many seizing <lb/>
hold of the chain-plates and springing into the chains; others, <lb/>
at the peril of being run over by the vessel in her course, <reg orig="catch-|ing">catching</reg> <lb/>
at the bob-stays, and wreathing their slender forms about the <lb/>
ropes, hung suspended in the air. All of them at length <reg orig="suc-|ceeded">succeeded</reg> <lb/>
in getting up the ship's side, where they clung dripping <lb/>
with the brine and glowing from the bath, their jet-black tresses <lb/>
streaming over their shoulders, and half enveloping their <reg orig="other-|wise">otherwise</reg> <lb/>
naked forms. There they hung, sparkling with savage <lb/>
vivacity, laughing gaily at one another, and chattering away with <lb/>
infinite glee. Nor were they idle the while, for each one <reg orig="per-|formed">performed</reg> <lb/>
the simple offices of the toilette for the other. Their <lb/>
luxuriant locks, wound up and twisted into the smallest possible <lb/>
compass, were freed from the briny element; the whole person <lb/>
carefully dried, and from a little round shell that passed from <lb/>
hand to hand, anointed with a fragrant oil: their adornments <lb/>
were completed by passing a few loose folds of white tappa, in a <lb/>
modest cincture, around the waist. Thus arrayed they no longer <lb/>
hesitated, but flung themselves lightly over the bulwarks, and <lb/>
were quickly frolicking about the decks. Many of them went <lb/>
forward, perching upon the head-rails or running out upon the <lb/>
bowsprit, while others seated themselves upon the taffrail, or <reg orig="re-|clined">reclined</reg> <lb/>
at full length upon the boats. What a sight for us <lb/>
bachelor sailors! how avoid so dire a temptation? For who <lb/>
could think of tumbling these artless creatures overboard, when <lb/>
they had swam miles to welcome us?</p>
<p>Their appearance perfectly amazed me; their extreme youth, <lb/>
the light clear brown of their complexions, their delicate <reg orig="fea-|tures">features</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="15" entity="z000000574_0042" pid="uva-lib:244494"/>
and inexpressibly graceful figures, their softly moulded <lb/>
limbs, and free unstudied action, seemed as strange as beautiful.</p>
<p>The `Dolly' was fairly captured; and never I will say was <lb/>
vessel carried before by such a dashing and irresistible party of <lb/>
boarders! The ship taken, we could not do otherwise than yield <lb/>
ourselves prisoners, and for the whole period that she remained <lb/>
in the bay, the `Dolly,' as well as her crew, were completely in <lb/>
the hands of the mermaids.</p>
<p>In the evening after we had come to an anchor the deck was <lb/>
illuminated with lanterns, and this picturesque band of sylphs, <lb/>
tricked out with flowers, and dressed in robes of variegated tappa, <lb/>
got up a ball in great style. These females are passionately fond <lb/>
of dancing, and in the wild grace and spirit of their style excel <lb/>
everything that I have ever seen. The varied dances of the <lb/>
Marquesan girls are beautiful in the extreme, but there is an <lb/>
abandoned voluptuousness in their character which I dare not <lb/>
attempt to describe.</p>
<p>Our ship was now wholly given up to every species of riot and <lb/>
debauchery. Not the feeblest barrier was interposed between <lb/>
the unholy passions of the crew and their unlimited gratification. <lb/>
The grossest licentiousness and the most shameful inebriety <reg orig="pre-|vailed">prevailed</reg>, <lb/>
with occasional and but short-lived interruptions, through <lb/>
the whole period of her stay. Alas for the poor savages when <lb/>
exposed to the influence of these polluting examples! <reg orig="Unso-|phisticated">Unsophisticated</reg> <lb/>
and confiding, they are easily led into every vice, <lb/>
and humanity weeps over the ruin thus remorselessly inflicted <lb/>
upon them by their European civilizers. Thrice happy are they <lb/>
who, inhabiting some yet undiscovered island in the midst of the <lb/>
ocean, have never been brought into contaminating contact with <lb/>
the white man.</p>

</argument>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was in the summer of 1842 that we arrived at the islands; <lb/>
the French had then held possession of them for several weeks. <lb/>
During this time they had visited some of the principal places <lb/>
in the group, and had disembarked at various points about five <lb/>
hundred troops. These were employed in constructing works of <lb/>
defence, and otherwise providing against the attacks of the <reg orig="na-|tives">natives</reg>, <lb/>
who at any moment might be expected to break out in <lb/>
open hostility. The islanders looked upon the people who made <lb/>
this cavalier appropriation of their shores with mingled feelings <lb/>
of fear and detestation. They cordially hated them; but the <lb/>
impulses of their resentment were neutralized by their dread of <lb/>
the floating batteries, which lay with their fatal tubes <reg orig="ostenta-|tiously">ostentatiously</reg> <lb/>
pointed, not at fortifications and redoubts, but at a <reg orig="hand-|ful">handful</reg> <lb/>
of bamboo sheds, sheltered in a grove of cocoa-nuts! A <lb/>
valiant warrior doubtless, but a prudent one too, was this same <lb/>
Rear-Admiral Du Petit Thouars. Four heavy, double-banked <lb/>
frigates and three corvettes to frighten a parcel of naked <lb/>
heathen into subjection! Sixty-eight pounders to demolish huts <lb/>
of cocoa-nut boughs, and Congreve rockets to set on fire a few <lb/>
canoe sheds!</p>
<p>At Nukuheva, there were about one hundred soldiers ashore. <lb/>
They were encamped in tents, constructed of the old sails and <lb/>
spare spars of the squadron, within the limits of a redoubt <lb/>
mounted with a few nine-pounders, and surrounded with a fosse. <lb/>
Every other day, these troops were marched out in martial array, <lb/>
to a level piece of ground in the vicinity, and there for hours <lb/>
<pb n="17" entity="z000000574_0044" pid="uva-lib:244496"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">C</fw></pb>
went through all sorts of military evolutions, surrounded by <lb/>
flocks of the natives, who looked on with savage admiration at <lb/>
the show, and as savage a hatred of the actors. A regiment of <lb/>
the Old Guard, reviewed on a summer's day in the Champs <lb/>
Elys&eacute;es, could not have made a more critically correct <reg orig="appear-|ance">appearance</reg>. <lb/>
The officers' regimentals, resplendent with gold lace and <lb/>
embroidery, as if purposely calculated to dazzle the islanders, <lb/>
looked as if just unpacked from their Parisian cases.</p>
<p>The sensation produced by the presence of the strangers had <lb/>
not in the least subsided at the period of our arrival at the <lb/>
islands. The natives still flocked in numbers about the <reg orig="encamp-|ment">encampment</reg>, <lb/>
and watched with the liveliest curiosity everything that <lb/>
was going forward. A blacksmith's forge, which had been set <lb/>
up in the shelter of a grove near the beach, attracted so great a <lb/>
crowd, that it required the utmost efforts of the sentries posted <lb/>
around to keep the inquisitive multitude at a sufficient distance <lb/>
to allow the workmen to ply their vocation. But nothing gained <lb/>
so large a share of admiration as a horse, which had been <lb/>
brought from Valparaiso by the Achille, one of the vessels of <lb/>
the squadron. The animal, a remarkably fine one, had been <lb/>
taken ashore and stabled in a hut of cocoa-nut boughs within <lb/>
the fortified enclosure. Occasionally it was brought out, and, <lb/>
being gaily caparisoned, was ridden by one of the officers at full <lb/>
speed over the hard sand beach. This performance was sure to <lb/>
be hailed with loud plaudits, and the "puarkee nuee" (big hog) <lb/>
was unanimously pronounced by the islanders to be the most <lb/>
extraordinary specimen of zoology that had ever come under <lb/>
their observation.</p>
<p>The expedition for the occupation of the Marquesas had sailed <lb/>
from Brest in the spring of 1842, and the secret of its <reg orig="desti-|nation">destination</reg> <lb/>
was solely in the possession of its commander. No <lb/>
wonder that those who contemplated such a signal infraction of <lb/>
the rights of humanity should have sought to veil the enormity <lb/>
from the eyes of the world. And yet, notwithstanding their <lb/>
iniquitous conduct in this and in other matters, the French have <lb/>
ever plumed themselves upon being the most humane and <reg orig="po-|lished">polished</reg> <lb/>
of nations. A high degree of refinement, however, does <lb/>
not seem to subdue our wicked propensities so much after all; <lb/>
and were civilization itself to be estimated by some of its results, <lb/>
<pb n="18" entity="z000000574_0045" pid="uva-lib:244497"/>
it would seem perhaps better for what we call the barbarous <lb/>
part of the world to remain unchanged.</p>
<p>One example of the shameless subterfuges under which the <lb/>
French stand prepared to defend whatever cruelties they may <lb/>
hereafter think fit to commit in bringing the Marquesan natives <lb/>
into subjection is well worthy of being recorded. On some <lb/>
flimsy pretext or other Mowanna, the king of Nukuheva, whom <lb/>
the invaders by extravagant presents have cajoled over to their <lb/>
interests, and move about like a mere puppet, has been set up <lb/>
as the rightful sovereign of the entire island,&mdash;the alleged ruler <lb/>
by prescription of various clans who for ages perhaps have <lb/>
treated with each other as separate nations. To reinstate this <lb/>
much-injured prince in the assumed dignities of his ancestors, <lb/>
the disinterested strangers have come all the way from France: <lb/>
they are determined that his title shall be acknowledged. If any <lb/>
tribe shall refuse to recognise the authority of the French, by <lb/>
bowing down to the laced chapeau of Mowanna, let them abide <lb/>
the consequences of their obstinacy. Under cover of a similar <lb/>
pretence, have the outrages and massacres at Tahiti the beautiful, <lb/>
the queen of the South Seas, been perpetrated.</p>
<p>On this buccaneering expedition, Rear-Admiral Du Petit <lb/>
Thouars, leaving the rest of his squadron at the Marquesas&mdash; <lb/>
which had then been occupied by his forces about five months&mdash; <lb/>
set sail for the doomed island in the Reine Blanche frigate. On <lb/>
his arrival, as an indemnity for alleged insults offered to the flag <lb/>
of his country, he demanded some twenty or thirty thousand <lb/>
dollars to be placed in his hands forthwith, and in default of <lb/>
payment, threatened to land and take possession of the place.</p>
<p>The frigate, immediately upon coming to an anchor, got <lb/>
springs on her cables, and with her guns cast loose and her men <lb/>
at their quarters, lay in the circular basin of Papeete, with her <lb/>
broadside bearing upon the devoted town; while her numerous <lb/>
cutters, hauled in order alongside, were ready to effect a landing, <lb/>
under cover of her batteries. She maintained this belligerent <lb/>
attitude for several days, during which time a series of informal <lb/>
negotiations were pending, and wide alarm spread over the <lb/>
island. Many of the Tahitians were at first disposed to resort <lb/>
to arms, and drive the invaders from their shores; but more <lb/>
pacific and feebler councils ultimately prevailed. The <reg orig="unfortu-|nate">unfortunate</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="19" entity="z000000574_0046" pid="uva-lib:244498"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">C 2</fw></pb>
queen, Pomare, incapable of averting the impending <reg orig="ca-|lamity">calamity</reg>, <lb/>
terrified at the arrogance of the insolent Frenchman, <lb/>
and driven at last to despair, fled by night in a canoe to Emio.</p>
<p>During the continuance of the panic there occurred an <reg orig="in-|stance">instance</reg> <lb/>
of feminine heroism that I cannot omit to record.</p>
<p>In the grounds of the famous missionary consul, Pritchard, <lb/>
then absent in London, the consular flag of Britain waved as <lb/>
usual during the day, from a lofty staff planted within a few <lb/>
yards of the beach, and in full view of the frigate. One <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg> <lb/>
an officer, at the head of a party of men, presented himself <lb/>
at the verandah of Mr. Pritchard's house, and inquired in broken <lb/>
English for the lady his wife. The matron soon made her <lb/>
appearance; and the polite Frenchman, making one of his best <lb/>
bows, and playing gracefully with the aguilettes that danced <lb/>
upon his breast, proceeded in courteous accents to deliver his <lb/>
mission. "The admiral desired the flag to be hauled down&mdash; <lb/>
hoped it would be perfectly agreeable&mdash;and his men stood ready <lb/>
to perform the duty." "Tell the pirate your master," replied the <lb/>
spirited Englishwoman, pointing to the staff, "that if he wishes <lb/>
to strike those colours, he must come and perform the act <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>; <lb/>
I will suffer no one else to do it." The lady then bowed <lb/>
haughtily and withdrew into the house. As the discomfited <lb/>
officer slowly walked away, he looked up to the flag, and <reg orig="per-|ceived">perceived</reg> <lb/>
that the cord by which it was elevated to its place, led <lb/>
from the top of the staff, across the lawn, to an open upper <reg orig="win-|dow">window</reg> <lb/>
of the mansion, where sat the lady from whom he had just <lb/>
parted, tranquilly engaged in knitting. Was that flag hauled <lb/>
down? Mrs. Pritchard thinks not; and Rear Admiral Du <lb/>
Petit Thouars is believed to be of the same opinion.</p>

</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Our</hi> ship had not been many days in the harbour of Nukuheva <lb/>
before I came to the determination of leaving her. That my <lb/>
reasons for resolving to take this step were numerous and weighty, <lb/>
may be inferred from the fact that I chose rather to risk my <reg orig="for-|tunes">fortunes</reg> <lb/>
among the savages of the island than to endure another <lb/>
voyage on board the Dolly. To use the concise, point-blank <lb/>
phrase of the sailors, I had made up my mind to "run away." <lb/>
Now as a meaning is generally attached to these two words no <lb/>
way flattering to the individual to whom they are applied, it <lb/>
behoves me, for the sake of my own character, to offer some <lb/>
explanation of my conduct.</p>
<p>When I entered on board the Dolly, I signed as a matter of <lb/>
course the ship's articles, thereby voluntarily engaging and <lb/>
legally binding myself to serve in a certain capacity for the <lb/>
period of the voyage; and, special considerations apart, I was of <lb/>
course bound to fulfill the agreement. But in all contracts, if <lb/>
one party fail to perform his share of the compact, is not the <lb/>
other virtually absolved from his liability? Who is there who <lb/>
will not answer in the affirmative?</p>
<p>Having settled the principle, then, let me apply it to the <lb/>
particular case in question. In numberless instances had not <lb/>
only the implied but the specified conditions of the articles <lb/>
been violated on the part of the ship in which I served. The <lb/>
usage on board of her was tyrannical; the sick had been <reg orig="in-|humanly">inhumanly</reg> <lb/>
neglected; the provisions had been doled out in scanty <lb/>
allowance; and her cruizes were unreasonably protracted. The <lb/>
captain was the author of these abuses; it was in vain to think <lb/>
<pb n="21" entity="z000000574_0048" pid="uva-lib:244500"/>
that he would either remedy them, or alter his conduct, which <lb/>
was arbitrary and violent in the extreme. His prompt reply to <lb/>
all complaints and remonstrances was&mdash;the butt end of a <reg orig="hand-|spike">handspike</reg>, <lb/>
so convincingly administered as effectually to silence the <lb/>
aggrieved party.</p>
<p>To whom could we apply for redress? We had left both law <lb/>
and equity on the other side of the Cape; and unfortunately, with <lb/>
a very few exceptions, our crew was composed of a parcel of <lb/>
dastardly and mean-spirited wretches, divided among themselves, <lb/>
and only united in enduring without resistance the unmitigated <lb/>
tyranny of the captain. It would have been mere madness for <lb/>
any two or three of the number, unassisted by the rest, to attempt <lb/>
making a stand against his ill usage. They would only have <lb/>
called down upon themselves the particular vengeance of this <lb/>
"Lord of the Plank," and subjected their shipmates to additional <lb/>
hardships.</p>
<p>But, after all, these things could have been endured awhile, <lb/>
had we entertained the hope of being speedily delivered from <lb/>
them by the due completion of the term of our servitude. But <lb/>
what a dismal prospect awaited us in this quarter! The longevity <lb/>
of Cape Horn whaling voyages is proverbial, frequently extending <lb/>
over a period of four or five years.</p>
<p>Some long-haired, bare-necked youths, who, forced by the <lb/>
united influences of Captain Marryatt and hard times, embark at <lb/>
Nantucket for a pleasure excursion to the Pacific, and whose <lb/>
anxious mothers provide them with bottled milk for the occasion, <lb/>
oftentimes return very respectable middle-aged gentlemen.</p>
<p>The very preparations made for one of these expeditions are <lb/>
enough to frighten one. As the vessel carries out no cargo, her <lb/>
hold is filled with provisions for her own consumption. The <lb/>
owners, who officiate as caterers for the voyage, supply the larder <lb/>
with an abundance of dainties. Delicate morsels of beef and <lb/>
pork, cut on scientific principles from every part of the animal, <lb/>
and of all conceivable shapes and sizes, are carefully packed in <lb/>
salt, and stored away in barrels; affording a never-ending variety <lb/>
in their different degrees of toughness, and in the peculiarities of <lb/>
their saline properties. Choice old water too, decanted into <lb/>
stout six-barrel-casks, and two pints of which are allowed every <lb/>
day to each soul on board; together with ample store of sea-bread, <lb/>
<pb n="22" entity="z000000574_0049" pid="uva-lib:244501"/>
previously reduced to a state of petrifaction, with a view to <reg orig="pre-|serve">preserve</reg> <lb/>
it either from decay or consumption in the ordinary mode, <lb/>
are likewise provided for the nourishment and gastronomic <reg orig="enjoy-|ment">enjoyment</reg> <lb/>
of the crew.</p>
<p>But not to speak of the quality of these articles of sailors' fare, <lb/>
the abundance in which they are put on board a whaling vessel <lb/>
is almost incredible. Oftentimes, when we had occasion to break <lb/>
out in the hold, and I beheld the successive tiers of casks and <lb/>
barrels, whose contents were all destined to be consumed in due <lb/>
course by the ship's company, my heart has sunk within me.</p>
<p>Although, as a general case, a ship unlucky in falling in with <lb/>
whales continues to cruize after them until she has barely <reg orig="suffi-|cient">sufficient</reg> <lb/>
provisions remaining to take her home, turning round then <lb/>
quietly and making the best of her way to her friends, yet there <lb/>
are instances when even this natural obstacle to the further <reg orig="pro-|secution">prosecution</reg> <lb/>
of the voyage is overcome by headstrong captains, who, <lb/>
bartering the fruits of their hard-earned toils for a new supply of <lb/>
provisions in some of the ports of Chili or Peru, begin the voyage <lb/>
afresh with unabated zeal and perseverance. It is in vain that <lb/>
the owners write urgent letters to him to sail for home, and for <lb/>
their sake to bring back the ship, since it appears he can put <lb/>
nothing in her. Not he. He has registered a vow: he will fill <lb/>
his vessel with good sperm oil, or failing to do so, never again <lb/>
strike Yankee soundings.</p>
<p>I heard of one whaler, which after many years' absence was <lb/>
given up for lost. The last that had been heard of her was a <lb/>
shadowy report of her having touched at some of those unstable <lb/>
islands in the far Pacific, whose eccentric wanderings are <reg orig="care-|fully">carefully</reg> <lb/>
noted in each new edition of the South-Sea charts. After <lb/>
a long interval, however, `The Perseverance'&mdash;for that was her <lb/>
name&mdash;was spoken somewhere in the vicinity of the ends of the <lb/>
earth, cruizing along as leisurely as ever, her sails all bepatched <lb/>
and bequilted with rope-yarns, her spars fished with old pipe <lb/>
stores, and her rigging knotted and spliced in every possible <lb/>
direction. Her crew was composed of some twenty venerable <lb/>
Greenwich-pensioner-looking old salts, who just managed to <lb/>
hobble about deck. The ends of all the running ropes, with the <lb/>
exception of the signal halyards and poop-down-haul, were rove <lb/>
through snatch-blocks, and led to the capstan or windlass, so <lb/>
<pb n="23" entity="z000000574_0050" pid="uva-lib:244502"/>
that not a yard was braced or a sail set without the assistance of <lb/>
machinery.</p>
<p>Her hull was incrusted with barnacles, which completely <reg orig="en-|cased">encased</reg> <lb/>
her. Three pet sharks followed in her wake, and every <lb/>
day came alongside to regale themselves from the contents of the <lb/>
cook's bucket, which were pitched over to them. A vast shoal <lb/>
of bonetas and albicores always kept her company.</p>
<p>Such as the account I heard of this vessel, and the <reg orig="remem-|brance">remembrance</reg> <lb/>
of it always haunted me; what eventually became of her <lb/>
I never learned; at any rate she never reached home, and I <reg orig="sup-|pose">suppose</reg> <lb/>
she is still regularly tacking twice in the twenty-four hours <lb/>
somewhere off Buggerry Island, or the Devil's-Tail Peak.</p>
<p>Having said thus much touching the usual length of these <lb/>
voyages, when I inform the reader that ours had as it were just <lb/>
commenced, we being only fifteen months out, and even at that <lb/>
time hailed as a late arrival, and boarded for news, he will <lb/>
readily perceive that there was little to encourage one in looking <lb/>
forward to the future, especially as I had always had a <reg orig="presenti-|ment">presentiment</reg> <lb/>
that we should make an unfortunate voyage, and our <reg orig="ex-|perience">experience</reg> <lb/>
so far had justified the expectation.</p>
<p>I may here state, and on my faith as an honest man, that <lb/>
though more than three years have elapsed since I left this same <lb/>
identical vessel, she still continues in the Pacific, and but a few <lb/>
days since I saw her reported in the papers as having touched at <lb/>
the Sandwich Islands previous to going on the coast of Japan.</p>
<p>But to return to my narrative. Placed in these circumstances <lb/>
then, with no prospect of matters mending if I remained aboard <lb/>
the Dolly, I at once made up my mind to leave her: to be <lb/>
sure it was rather an inglorious thing to steal away privily from <lb/>
those at whose hands I had received wrongs and outrages that I <lb/>
could not resent; but how was such a course to be avoided when <lb/>
it was the only alternative left me? Having made up my mind, <lb/>
I proceeded to acquire all the information I could obtain relating <lb/>
to the island and its inhabitants, with a view of shaping my plans <lb/>
of escape accordingly. The result of these inquiries I will now <lb/>
state, in order that the ensuing narrative may be the better <reg orig="un-|derstood">understood</reg>.</p>
<p>The bay of Nukuheva in which we were then lying is an <reg orig="ex-|panse">expanse</reg> <lb/>
of water not unlike in figure the space included within the <lb/>
<pb n="24" entity="z000000574_0051" pid="uva-lib:244503"/>
limits of a horse-shoe. It is, perhaps, nine miles in <reg orig="circumfer-|ence">circumference</reg>. <lb/>
You approach it from the sea by a narrow entrance, <lb/>
flanked on either side by two small twin islets which soar <reg orig="coni-|cally">conically</reg> <lb/>
to the height of some five hundred feet. From these the <lb/>
shore recedes on both hands, and describes a deep semicircle.</p>
<p>From the verge of the water the land rises uniformly on all <lb/>
sides, with green and sloping acclivities, until from gently rolling <lb/>
hill-sides and moderate elevations it insensibly swells into lofty <lb/>
and majestic heights, whose blue outlines, ranged all around, <lb/>
close in the view. The beautiful aspect of the shore is heightened <lb/>
by deep and romantic glens, which come down to it at almost <lb/>
equal distances, all apparently radiating from a common centre, <lb/>
and the upper extremities of which are lost to the eye beneath <lb/>
the shadow of the mountains. Down each of these little valleys <lb/>
flows a clear stream, here and there assuming the form of a <lb/>
slender cascade, then stealing invisibly along until it burst upon <lb/>
the sight again in larger and more noisy waterfalls, and at last <lb/>
demurely wanders along to the sea.</p>
<p>The houses of the natives, constructed of the yellow bamboo, <lb/>
tastefully twisted together in a kind of wicker-work, and thatched <lb/>
with the long tapering leaves of the palmetto, are scattered <reg orig="irre-|gularly">irregularly</reg> <lb/>
along these valleys beneath the shady branches of the <lb/>
cocoa-nut trees.</p>
<p>Nothing can exceed the imposing scenery of this bay. Viewed <lb/>
from our ship as she lay at anchor in the middle of the harbour, <lb/>
it presented the appearance of a vast natural amphitheatre in <lb/>
decay, and overgrown with vines, the deep glens that furrowed <lb/>
its sides appearing like enormous fissures caused by the ravages of <lb/>
time. Very often when lost in admiration at its beauty, I have <lb/>
experienced a pang of regret that a scene so enchanting should <lb/>
be hidden from the world in these remote seas, and seldom meet <lb/>
the eyes of devoted lovers of nature.</p>
<p>Besides this bay the shores of the island are indented by several <lb/>
other extensive inlets, into which descend broad and verdant <lb/>
valleys. These are inhabited by as many distinct tribes of <lb/>
savages, who, although speaking kindred dialects of a common <lb/>
language, and having the same religion and laws, have from time <lb/>
immemorial waged hereditary warfare against each other. The <lb/>
intervening mountains, generally two or three thousand feet above <lb/>
<pb n="25" entity="z000000574_0052" pid="uva-lib:244504"/>
the level of the sea, geographically define the territories of each <lb/>
of these hostile tribes, who never cross them, save on some <reg orig="ex-|pedition">expedition</reg> <lb/>
of war or plunder. Immediately adjacent to Nukuheva, <lb/>
and only separated from it by the mountains seen from the <lb/>
harbour, lies the lovely valley of Happar, whose inmates cherish <lb/>
the most friendly relations with the inhabitants of Nukuheva. <lb/>
On the other side of Happar, and closely adjoining it, is the <reg orig="mag-|nificent">magnificent</reg> <lb/>
valley of the dreaded Typees, the unappeasable enemies <lb/>
of both these tribes.</p>
<p>These celebrated warriors appear to inspire the other islanders <lb/>
with unspeakable terrors. Their very name is a frightful one; <lb/>
for the word "Typee" in the Marquesan dialect signifies a lover <lb/>
of human flesh. It is rather singular that the title should have <lb/>
been bestowed upon them exclusively, inasmuch as the natives of <lb/>
all this group are irreclaimable cannibals. The name may, <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg>, <lb/>
have been given to denote the peculiar ferocity of this clan, <lb/>
and to convey a special stigma along with it.</p>
<p>These same Typees enjoy a prodigious notoriety all over the <lb/>
islands. The natives of Nukuheva would frequently recount in <lb/>
pantomime to our ship's company their terrible feats, and would <lb/>
show the marks of wounds they had received in desperate <reg orig="en-|counters">encounters</reg> <lb/>
with them. When ashore they would try to frighten <lb/>
us by pointing to one of their own number, and calling him a <lb/>
Typee, manifesting no little surprise that we did not take to our <lb/>
heels at so terrible an announcement. It was quite amusing, too, <lb/>
to see with what earnestness they disclaimed all cannibal <reg orig="propen-|sities">propensities</reg> <lb/>
on their own part, while they denounced their enemies&mdash;the <lb/>
Typees&mdash;as inveterate gormandizers of human flesh; but this is <lb/>
a peculiarity to which I shall hereafter have occasion to allude.</p>
<p>Although I was convinced that the inhabitants of our bay <lb/>
were as arrant cannibals as any of the other tribes on the island, <lb/>
still I could not but feel a particular and most unqualified <reg orig="re-|pugnance">repugnance</reg> <lb/>
to the aforesaid Typees. Even before visiting the <lb/>
Marquesas, I had heard from men who had touched at the group <lb/>
on former voyages some revolting stories in connection with <lb/>
these savages; and fresh in my remembrance was the adventure <lb/>
of the master of the Katherine, who only a few months <reg orig="pre-|vious">previous</reg>, <lb/>
imprudently venturing into this bay in an armed boat for <lb/>
the purpose of barter, was seized by the natives, carried back a <lb/>
<pb n="26" entity="z000000574_0053" pid="uva-lib:244505"/>
little distance into their valley, and was only saved from a cruel <lb/>
death by the intervention of a young girl, who facilitated his <lb/>
escape by night along the beach to Nukuheva.</p>
<p>I had heard too of an English vessel that many years ago, after <lb/>
a weary cruize, sought to enter the bay of Nukuheva, and <reg orig="ar-|riving">arriving</reg> <lb/>
within two or three miles of the land, was met by a large <lb/>
canoe filled with natives, who offered to lead the way to the place <lb/>
of their destination. The captain, unacquainted with the <reg orig="locali-|ties">localities</reg> <lb/>
of the island, joyfully acceded to the proposition&mdash;the canoe <lb/>
paddled on and the ship followed. She was soon conducted to a <lb/>
beautiful inlet, and dropped her anchor in its waters beneath the <lb/>
shadows of the lofty shore. That same night the perfidious <lb/>
Typees, who had thus inveigled her into their fatal bay, flocked <lb/>
aboard the doomed vessel by hundreds, and at a given signal <lb/>
murdered every soul on board.</p>
<p>I shall never forget the observation of one of our crew as we <lb/>
were passing slowly by the entrance of this bay in our way to <lb/>
Nukuheva. As we stood gazing over the side at the verdant <lb/>
headlands, Ned, pointing with his hand in the direction of the <lb/>
treacherous valley, exclaimed, "There&mdash;there's Typee. Oh, <lb/>
the bloody cannibals, what a meal they'd make of us if we were <lb/>
to take it into our heads to land! but they say they don't like <lb/>
sailor's flesh, it's too salt. I say, maty, how should you like to <lb/>
be shoved ashore there, eh?" I little thought, as I shuddered at <lb/>
the question, that in the space of a few weeks I should actually <lb/>
be a captive in that self-same valley.</p>
<p>The French, although they had gone through the ceremony <lb/>
of hoisting their colours for a few hours at all the principal places <lb/>
of the group, had not as yet visited the bay of Typee, <reg orig="antici-|pating">anticipating</reg> <lb/>
a fierce resistance on the part of the savages there, which <lb/>
for the present at least they wished to avoid. Perhaps they were <lb/>
not a little influenced in the adoption of this unusual policy from <lb/>
a recollection of the warlike reception given by the Typees to the <lb/>
forces of Captain Porter, about the year 1814, when that brave <lb/>
and accomplished officer endeavoured to subjugate the clan merely <lb/>
to gratify the mortal hatred of his allies the Nukuhevas and <lb/>
Happars.</p>
<p>On that occasion I have been told that a considerable <reg orig="detach-|ment">detachment</reg> <lb/>
of sailors and marines from the frigate Essex, accompanied <lb/>
<pb n="27" entity="z000000574_0054" pid="uva-lib:244506"/>
by at least two thousand warriors of Happar and Nukuheva, <lb/>
landed in boats and canoes at the head of the bay, and after <reg orig="pene-|trating">penetrating</reg> <lb/>
a little distance into the valley, met with the stoutest <lb/>
resistance from its inmates. Valiantly, although with much loss, <lb/>
the Typees disputed every inch of ground, and after some hard <lb/>
fighting obliged their assailants to retreat and abandon their <lb/>
design of conquest.</p>
<p>The invaders, on their march back to the sea, consoled <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
for their repulse by setting fire to every house and temple <lb/>
in their route; and a long line of smoking ruins defaced the <lb/>
once-smiling bosom of the valley, and proclaimed to its pagan <lb/>
inhabitants the spirit that reigned in the breasts of Christian <lb/>
soldiers. Who can wonder at the deadly hatred of the Typees <lb/>
to all foreigners after such unprovoked atrocities?</p>
<p>Thus it is that they whom we denominate "savages" are made <lb/>
to deserve the title. When the inhabitants of some sequestered <lb/>
island first descry the "big canoe" of the European rolling <lb/>
through the blue waters towards their shores, they rush down to <lb/>
the beach in crowds, and with open arms stand ready to embrace <lb/>
the strangers. Fatal embrace! They fold to their bosoms the <lb/>
vipers whose sting is destined to poison all their joys; and the <lb/>
instinctive feeling of love within their breasts is soon converted <lb/>
into the bitterest hate.</p>
<p>The enormities perpetrated in the South Seas upon some of <lb/>
the inoffensive islanders wellnigh pass belief. These things are <lb/>
seldom proclaimed at home; they happen at the very ends of the <lb/>
earth; they are done in a corner, and there are none to reveal <lb/>
them. But there is, nevertheless, many a petty trader that has <lb/>
navigated the Pacific whose course from island to island might <lb/>
be traced by a series of cold-blooded robberies, kidnappings, and <lb/>
murders, the iniquity of which might be considered almost <reg orig="suffi-|cient">sufficient</reg> <lb/>
to sink her guilty timbers to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Sometimes vague accounts of such things reach our firesides, <lb/>
and we coolly censure them as wrong, impolitic, needlessly severe, <lb/>
and dangerous to the crews of other vessels. How different is <lb/>
our tone when we read the highly-wrought description of the <lb/>
massacre of the crew of the Hobomak by the Feejees; how we <lb/>
sympathise for the unhappy victims, and with what horror do we <lb/>
regard the diabolical heathens, who, after all, have but avenged <lb/>
<pb n="28" entity="z000000574_0055" pid="uva-lib:244507"/>
the unprovoked injuries which they have received. We breathe <lb/>
nothing but vengeance, and equip armed vessels to traverse <reg orig="thou-|sands">thousands</reg> <lb/>
of miles of ocean in order to execute summary punishment <lb/>
upon the offenders. On arriving at their destination, they burn, <lb/>
slaughter, and destroy, according to the tenor of written <reg orig="instruc-|tions">instructions</reg>, <lb/>
and sailing away from the scene of devastation, call upon <lb/>
all Christendom to applaud their courage and their justice.</p>
<p>How often is the term "savages" incorrectly applied! None <lb/>
really deserving of it were ever yet discovered by voyagers or by <lb/>
travellers. They have discovered heathens and barbarians, whom <lb/>
by horrible cruelties they have exasperated into savages. It <lb/>
may be asserted without fear of contradiction, that in all the <lb/>
cases of outrages committed by Polynesians, Europeans have at <lb/>
some time or other been the aggressors, and that the cruel and <lb/>
bloodthirsty disposition of some of the islanders is mainly to be <lb/>
ascribed to the influence of such examples.</p>
<p>But to return. Owing to the mutual hostilities of the different <lb/>
tribes I have mentioned, the mountainous tracts which separate <lb/>
their respective territories remain altogether uninhabited; the <lb/>
natives invariably dwelling in the depths of the valleys, with a <lb/>
view of securing themselves from the predatory incursions of <lb/>
their enemies, who often lurk along their borders, ready to cut <lb/>
off any imprudent straggler, or make a descent upon the inmates <lb/>
of some sequestered habitation. I several times met with very <lb/>
aged men, who from this cause had never passed the confines of <lb/>
their native vale, some of them having never even ascended <reg orig="mid-|way">midway</reg> <lb/>
up the mountains in the whole course of their lives, and <lb/>
who, accordingly, had little idea of the appearance of any other <lb/>
part of the island, the whole of which is not perhaps more than <lb/>
sixty miles in circuit. The little space in which some of these <lb/>
clans pass away their days would seem almost incredible.</p>
<p>The glen of Tior will furnish a curious illustration of this. <lb/>
The inhabited part is not more than four miles in length, and <lb/>
varies in breadth from half a mile to less than a quarter. The <lb/>
rocky vine-clad cliffs on one side tower almost perpendicularly <lb/>
from their base to the height of at least fifteen hundred feet; while <lb/>
across the vale&mdash;in striking contrast to the scenery opposite&mdash; <lb/>
grass-grown elevations rise one above another in blooming <reg orig="ter-|races">terraces</reg>. <lb/>
Hemmed in by these stupendous barriers, the valley would <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="z000000574_0056" pid="uva-lib:244508"/>
be altogether shut out from the rest of the world, were it not that <lb/>
it is accessible from the sea at one end, and by a narrow defile at <lb/>
the other.</p>
<p>The impression produced upon my mind, when I first visited <lb/>
this beautiful glen, will never be obliterated.</p>
<p>I had come from Nukuheva by water in the ship's boat, and <lb/>
when we entered the bay of Tior it was high noon. The heat <lb/>
had been intense, as we had been floating upon the long smooth <lb/>
swell of the ocean, for there was but little wind. The sun's rays <lb/>
had expended all their fury upon us; and to add to our discomfort, <lb/>
we had omitted to supply ourselves with water previous to <reg orig="start-|ing">starting</reg>. <lb/>
What with heat and thirst together, I became so impatient <lb/>
to get ashore, that when at last we glided towards it, I stood up <lb/>
in the bow of the boat ready for a spring. As she shot two-thirds <lb/>
of her length high upon the beach, propelled by three or four <lb/>
strong strokes of the oars, I leaped among a parcel of juvenile <lb/>
savages, who stood prepared to give us a kind reception; and <lb/>
with them at my heels, yelling like so many imps, I rushed <reg orig="for-|ward">forward</reg> <lb/>
across the open ground in the vicinity of the sea, and <lb/>
plunged, diver fashion, into the recesses of the first grove that <lb/>
offered.</p>
<p>What a delightful sensation did I experience! I felt as if <lb/>
floating in some new element, while all sort of gurgling, trickling, <lb/>
liquid sounds fell upon my ear. People may say what they will <lb/>
about the refreshing influences of a cold-water bath, but commend <lb/>
me when in a perspiration to the shade baths of Tior, beneath <lb/>
the cocoa-nut trees, and amidst the cool delightful atmosphere <lb/>
which surrounds them.</p>
<p>How shall I describe the scenery that met my eye, as I looked <lb/>
out from this verdant recess! The narrow valley, with its steep <lb/>
and close adjoining sides draperied with vines, and arched <reg orig="over-|head">overhead</reg> <lb/>
with a fret-work of interlacing boughs, nearly hidden from <lb/>
view by masses of leafy verdure, seemed from where I stood like <lb/>
an immense arbour disclosing its vista to the eye, whilst as I <lb/>
advanced it insensibly widened into the loveliest vale eye ever <lb/>
beheld.</p>
<p>It so happened that the very day I was in Tior the French <lb/>
admiral, attended by all the boats of his squadron, came down in <lb/>
state from Nukuheva to take formal possession of the place. He <lb/>
<pb n="30" entity="z000000574_0057" pid="uva-lib:244509"/>
remained in the valley about two hours, during which time he <lb/>
had a ceremonious interview with the king.</p>
<p>The patriarch-sovereign of Tior was a man very far advanced <lb/>
in years; but though age had bowed his form and rendered him <lb/>
almost decrepid, his gigantic frame retained all its original <reg orig="mag-|nitude">magnitude</reg> <lb/>
and grandeur of appearance. He advanced slowly and <lb/>
with evident pain, assisting his tottering steps with the heavy <lb/>
war-spear he held in his hand, and attended by a group of <reg orig="grey-|bearded">grey-bearded</reg> <lb/>
chiefs, on one of whom he occasionally leaned for <reg orig="sup-|port">support</reg>. <lb/>
The admiral came forward with head uncovered and <reg orig="ex-|tended">extended</reg> <lb/>
hand, while the old king saluted him by a stately flourish <lb/>
of his weapon. The next moment they stood side by side, these <lb/>
two extremes of the social scale,&mdash;the polished, splendid <reg orig="French-|man">Frenchman</reg>, <lb/>
and the poor tattooed savage. They were both tall and <lb/>
noble-looking men; but in other respects how strikingly <reg orig="con-|trasted">contrasted</reg>! <lb/>
Du Petit Thouars exhibited upon his person all the <lb/>
paraphernalia of his naval rank. He wore a richly decorated <lb/>
admiral's frock-coat, a laced chapeau bras, and upon his breast <lb/>
were a variety of ribbons and orders; while the simple islander, <lb/>
with the exception of a slight cincture about his loins, appeared <lb/>
in all the nakedness of nature.</p>
<p>At what an immeasurable distance, thought I, are these two <lb/>
beings removed from each other. In the one is shown the result <lb/>
of long centuries of progressive civilization and refinement, which <lb/>
have gradually converted the mere creature into the semblance of <lb/>
all that is elevated and grand; while the other, after the lapse of <lb/>
the same period, has not advanced one step in the career of <reg orig="improve-|ment">improvement</reg>. <lb/>
"Yet, after all," quoth I to myself, "insensible as he is to <lb/>
a thousand wants, and removed from harassing cares, may not the <lb/>
savage be the happier man of the two?" Such were the thoughts <lb/>
that arose in my mind as I gazed upon the novel spectacle before <lb/>
me. In truth it was an impressive one, and little likely to be <lb/>
effaced. I can recall even now with vivid distinctness every <reg orig="fea-|ture">feature</reg> <lb/>
of the scene. The umbrageous shades where the interview <lb/>
took place&mdash;the glorious tropical vegetation around&mdash;the <reg orig="pic-|turesque">picturesque</reg> <lb/>
grouping of the mingled throng of soldiery and natives <lb/>
&mdash;and even the golden-hued bunch of banannas that I held in <lb/>
my hand at the time, and of which I occasionally partook while <lb/>
making the aforesaid philosophical reflections.</p>

</argument>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Having</hi> fully resolved to leave the vessel clandestinely, and <lb/>
having acquired all the knowledge concerning the bay that I <lb/>
could obtain under the circumstances in which I was placed, <lb/>
I now deliberately turned over in my mind every plan of escape <lb/>
that suggested itself, being determined to act with all possible <lb/>
prudence in an attempt where failure would be attended with so <lb/>
many disagreeable consequences. The idea of being taken and <lb/>
brought back ignominiously to the ship was so inexpressibly <lb/>
repulsive to me, that I was determined by no hasty and <reg orig="impru-|dent">imprudent</reg> <lb/>
measures to render such an event probable.</p>
<p>I knew that our worthy captain, who felt such a paternal <lb/>
solicitude for the welfare of his crew, would not willingly <reg orig="con-|sent">consent</reg> <lb/>
that one of his best hands should encounter the perils of a <lb/>
sojourn among the natives of a barbarous island; and I was <lb/>
certain that in the event of my disappearance, his fatherly <lb/>
anxiety would prompt him to offer, by way of a reward, yard <lb/>
upon yard of gaily printed calico for my apprehension. He <lb/>
might even have appreciated my services at the value of a <reg orig="mus-|ket">musket</reg>, <lb/>
in which case I felt perfectly certain that the whole <reg orig="popu-|lation">population</reg> <lb/>
of the bay would be immediately upon my track, incited <lb/>
by the prospect of so magnificent a bounty.</p>
<p>Having ascertained the fact before alluded to, that the <lb/>
islanders, from motives of precaution, dwelt altogether in the <lb/>
depths of the valleys, and avoided wandering about the more <lb/>
elevated portions of the shore, unless bound on some expedition <lb/>
of war or plunder, I concluded that if I could effect unperceived <lb/>
a passage to the mountains, I might easily remain among them, <lb/>
supporting myself by such fruits as came in my way until the <lb/>
sailing of the ship, an event of which I could not fail to be <reg orig="im-|mediately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="32" entity="z000000574_0059" pid="uva-lib:244511"/>
apprised, as from my lofty position I should command <lb/>
a view of the entire harbour.</p>
<p>The idea pleased me greatly. It seemed to combine a great <lb/>
deal of practicability with no inconsiderable enjoyment in a <lb/>
quiet way; for how delightful it would be to look down upon <lb/>
the detested old vessel from the height of some thousand feet, <lb/>
and contrast the verdant scenery about me with the recollection <lb/>
of her narrow decks and gloomy forecastle! Why, it was really <lb/>
refreshing even to think of it; and so I straightway fell to <reg orig="pic-|turing">picturing</reg> <lb/>
myself seated beneath a cocoa-nut tree on the brow of <lb/>
the mountain, with a cluster of plantains within easy reach, <lb/>
criticizing her nautical evolutions as she was working her way <lb/>
out of the harbour.</p>
<p>To be sure there was one rather unpleasant drawback to these <lb/>
agreeable anticipations&mdash;the possibility of falling in with a <reg orig="fo-|raging">foraging</reg> <lb/>
party of these same bloody-minded Typees, whose <reg orig="appe-|tites">appetites</reg>, <lb/>
edged perhaps by the air of so elevated a region, might <lb/>
prompt them to devour one. This, I must confess, was a most <lb/>
disagreeable view of the matter.</p>
<p>Just to think of a party of these unnatural gourmands taking <lb/>
it into their heads to make a convivial meal of a poor devil, who <lb/>
would have no means of escape or defence: however, there was <lb/>
no help for it. I was willing to encounter some risks in order <lb/>
to accomplish my object, and counted much upon my ability to <lb/>
elude these prowling cannibals amongst the many coverts which <lb/>
the mountains afforded. Besides, the chances were ten to one <lb/>
in my favour that they would none of them quit their own <reg orig="fast-|nesses">fastnesses</reg>.</p>
<p>I had determined not to communicate my design of <reg orig="with-|drawing">withdrawing</reg> <lb/>
from the vessel to any of my shipmates, and least of all <lb/>
to solicit any one to accompany me in my flight. But it so <lb/>
happened one night, that being upon deck, revolving over in my <lb/>
mind various plans of escape, I perceived one of the ship's <lb/>
company leaning over the bulwarks, apparently plunged in a <lb/>
profound reverie. He was a young fellow about my own age, <lb/>
for whom I had all along entertained a great regard; and Toby, <lb/>
such was the name by which he went among us, for his real <lb/>
name he would never tell us, was every way worthy of it. He <lb/>
<pb n="33" entity="z000000574_0060" pid="uva-lib:244512"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">D</fw></pb>
was active, ready, and obliging, of dauntless courage, and <reg orig="singu-|larly">singularly</reg> <lb/>
open and fearless in the expression of his feelings. I had <lb/>
on more than one occasion got him out of scrapes into which this <lb/>
had led him; and I know not whether it was from this cause, or <lb/>
a certain congeniality of sentiment between us, that he had <lb/>
always shown a partiality for my society. We had battled out <lb/>
many a long watch together, beguiling the weary hours with <lb/>
chat, song, and story, mingled with a good many imprecations <lb/>
upon the hard destiny it seemed our common fortune to <reg orig="en-|counter">encounter</reg>.</p>
<p>Toby, like myself, had evidently moved in a different sphere <lb/>
of life, and his conversation at times betrayed this, although he <lb/>
was anxious to conceal it. He was one of that class of rovers <lb/>
you sometimes meet at sea, who never reveal their origin, never <lb/>
allude to home, and go rambling over the world as if pursued <lb/>
by some mysterious fate they cannot possibly elude.</p>
<p>There was much even in the appearance of Toby calculated <lb/>
to draw me towards him, for while the greater part of the crew <lb/>
were as coarse in person as in mind, Toby was endowed with a <lb/>
remarkably prepossessing exterior. Arrayed in his blue frock <lb/>
and duck trousers, he was as smart a looking sailor as ever <lb/>
stepped upon a deck; he was singularly small and slightly made, <lb/>
with great flexibility of limb. His naturally dark complexion <lb/>
had been deepened by exposure to the tropical sun, and a mass <lb/>
of jetty locks clustered about his temples, and threw a darker <lb/>
shade into his large black eyes. He was a strange wayward <lb/>
being, moody, fitful, and melancholy&mdash;at times almost morose. <lb/>
He had a quick and fiery temper too, which, when thoroughly <lb/>
roused, transported him into a state bordering on delirium.</p>
<p>It is strange the power that a mind of deep passion has over <lb/>
feebler natures. I have seen a brawny fellow, with no lack of <lb/>
ordinary courage, fairly quail before this slender stripling, when <lb/>
in one of his furious fits. But these paroxysms seldom occurred, <lb/>
and in them my big-hearted shipmate vented the bile which <lb/>
more calm-tempered individuals get rid of by a continual <reg orig="pettish-|ness">pettishness</reg> <lb/>
at trival annoyances.</p>
<p>No one ever saw Toby laugh; I mean in the hearty <reg orig="aban-|donment">abandonment</reg> <lb/>
of broad-mouthed mirth. He did smile sometimes, it <lb/>
is true; and there was a good deal of dry, sarcastic humour <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="z000000574_0061" pid="uva-lib:244513"/>
about him, which told the more from the imperturbable gravity <lb/>
of his tone and manner.</p>
<p>Latterly I had observed that Toby's melancholy had greatly <lb/>
increased, and I had frequently seen him since our arrival at the <lb/>
island gazing wistfully upon the shore, when the remainder of <lb/>
the crew would be rioting below. I was aware that he <reg orig="enter-|tained">entertained</reg> <lb/>
a cordial detestation of the ship, and believed that, should <lb/>
a fair chance of escape present itself, he would embrace it <reg orig="will-|ingly">willingly</reg>. <lb/>
But the attempt was so perilous in the place where we <lb/>
then lay, that I supposed myself the only individual on board <lb/>
the ship who was sufficiently reckless to think of it. In this, <lb/>
however, I was mistaken.</p>
<p>When I perceived Toby leaning, as I have mentioned, against <lb/>
the bulwarks and buried in thought, it struck me at once that <lb/>
the subject of his meditations might be the same as my own. <lb/>
And if it be so, thought I, is he not the very one of all my <reg orig="ship-|mates">shipmates</reg> <lb/>
whom I would choose for the partner of my adventure? <lb/>
and why should I not have some comrade with me to divide its <lb/>
dangers and alleviate its hardships? Perhaps I might be obliged <lb/>
to lie concealed among the mountains for weeks. In such an <lb/>
event what a solace would a companion be?</p>
<p>These thoughts passed rapidly through my mind, and I <reg orig="won-|dered">wondered</reg> <lb/>
why I had not before considered the matter in this light. <lb/>
But it was not too late. A tap upon the shoulder served to <lb/>
rouse Toby from his reverie; I found him ripe for the <reg orig="enter-|prise">enterprise</reg>, <lb/>
and a very few words sufficed for a mutual understanding <lb/>
between us. In an hour's time we had arranged all the <reg orig="preli-|minaries">preliminaries</reg>, <lb/>
and decided upon our plan of action. We then ratified <lb/>
our engagement with an affectionate wedding of palms, and to <lb/>
elude suspicion repaired each to his hammock, to spend the last <lb/>
night on board the Dolly.</p>
<p>The next day the starboard watch, to which we both belonged, <lb/>
was to be sent ashore on liberty; and, availing ourselves of this <lb/>
opportunity, we determined, as soon after landing as possible, to <lb/>
separate ourselves from the rest of the men without exciting their <lb/>
suspicions, and strike back at once for the mountains. Seen <lb/>
from the ship, their summits appeared inaccessible, but here and <lb/>
there sloping spurs extended from them almost into the sea, <lb/>
buttressing the lofty elevations with which they were connected, <lb/>
<pb n="35" entity="z000000574_0062" pid="uva-lib:244514"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">D 2</fw></pb>
and forming those radiating valleys I have before described. <lb/>
One of these ridges, which appeared more practicable than the <lb/>
rest, we determined to climb, convinced that it would conduct <lb/>
us to the heights beyond. Accordingly, we carefully observed <lb/>
its bearings and locality from the ship, so that when ashore we <lb/>
should run no chance of missing it.</p>
<p>In all this the leading object we had in view was to seclude <lb/>
ourselves from sight until the departure of the vessel; then to <lb/>
take our chance as to the reception the Nukuheva natives <lb/>
might give us; and after remaining upon the island as long as <lb/>
we found our stay agreeable, to leave it the first favourable <reg orig="op-|portunity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
that offered.</p>

cabin gangway, harangued us as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Now, men, as we are just off a six months' cruise, and have <lb/>
got through most all our work in port here, I suppose you want <lb/>
to go ashore. Well, I mean to give your watch liberty to-day, <lb/>
so you may get ready as soon as you please, and go; but <reg orig="under-|stand">understand</reg> <lb/>
this, I am going to give you liberty because I suppose you <lb/>
would growl like so many old quarter gunners if I didn't; at <lb/>
the same time, if you'll take my advice, every mother's son of <lb/>
you will stay aboard, and keep out of the way of the bloody <reg orig="can-|nibals">cannibals</reg> <lb/>
altogether. Ten to one, men, if you go ashore, you will <lb/>
get into some infernal row, and that will be the end of you; for <lb/>
if those tattooed scoundrels get you a little ways back into their <lb/>
valleys, they'll nab you&mdash;that you may be certain of. Plenty of <lb/>
white men have gone ashore here and never been seen any more. <lb/>
There was the old Dido, she put in here about two years ago, and <lb/>
sent one watch off on liberty; they never were heard of again for <lb/>
a week&mdash;the natives swore they didn't know where they were&mdash; <lb/>
and only three of them ever got back to the ship again, and one <lb/>
with his face damaged for life, for the cursed heathens tattooed <lb/>
a broad patch clean across his figure-head. But it will be no <lb/>
use talking to you, for go you will, that I see plainly; so all I <lb/>
have to say is, that you need not blame me if the islanders make <lb/>
a meal of you. You may stand some chance of escaping them <lb/>
though, if you keep close about the French encampment, and are <lb/>
back to the ship again before sunset. Keep that much in your <lb/>
mind, if you forget all the rest I've been saying to you. There, <lb/>
go forward; bear a hand and rig yourselves, and stand by for a <lb/>
<pb n="37" entity="z000000574_0064" pid="uva-lib:244516"/>
call. At two bells the boat will be manned to take you off, and <lb/>
the Lord have mercy on you!"</p>
<p>Various were the emotions depicted upon the countenances of <lb/>
the starboard watch whilst listening to this address; but on its <lb/>
conclusion there was a general move towards the forecastle, and <lb/>
we soon were all busily engaged in getting ready for the holiday <lb/>
so auspiciously announced by the skipper. During these <reg orig="pre-|parations">preparations</reg> <lb/>
his harangue was commented upon in no very <reg orig="mea-|sured">measured</reg> <lb/>
terms; and one of the party, after denouncing him as a <lb/>
lying old son of a sea-cook who begrudged a fellow a few hours' <lb/>
liberty, exclaimed with an oath, "But you don't bounce me out <lb/>
of my liberty, old chap, for all your yarns; for I would go ashore <lb/>
if every pebble on the beach was a live coal, and every stick a <lb/>
gridiron, and the cannibals stood ready to broil me on landing."</p>
<p>The spirit of this sentiment was responded to by all hands, <lb/>
and we resolved that in spite of the captain's croakings we would <lb/>
make a glorious day of it.</p>
<p>But Toby and I had our own game to play, and we availed <lb/>
ourselves of the confusion which always reigns among a ship's <lb/>
company preparatory to going ashore, to confer together and <lb/>
complete our arrangements. As our object was to effect as rapid <lb/>
a flight as possible to the mountains, we determined not to <reg orig="en-|cumber">encumber</reg> <lb/>
ourselves with any superfluous apparel; and accordingly, <lb/>
while the rest were rigging themselves out with some idea of <lb/>
making a display, we were content to put on new stout duck <lb/>
trousers, serviceable pumps, and heavy Havre-frocks, which with <lb/>
a Payta hat completed our equipment.</p>
<p>When our shipmates wondered at this, Toby exclaimed in his <lb/>
odd grave way that the rest might do as they liked, but that he <lb/>
for one preserved his go-ashore traps for the Spanish main, where <lb/>
the tie of a sailor's neckerchief might make some difference; <lb/>
but as for a parcel of unbreeched heathen, he wouldn't go to <lb/>
the bottom of his chest for any of them, and was half disposed <lb/>
to appear among them in buff himself. The men laughed at <lb/>
what they thought was one of his strange conceits, and so we <lb/>
escaped suspicion.</p>
<p>It may appear singular that we should have been thus on our <lb/>
guard with our own shipmates; but there were some among us <lb/>
who, had they possessed the least inkling of our project, would, <lb/>
<pb n="38" entity="z000000574_0065" pid="uva-lib:244517"/>
for a paltry hope of reward, have immediately communicated it <lb/>
to the captain.</p>
<p>As soon as two bells were struck, the word was passed for the <lb/>
liberty-men to get into the boat. I lingered behind in the <reg orig="fore-|castle">forecastle</reg> <lb/>
a moment to take a parting glance at its familiar features, <lb/>
and just as I was about to ascend to the deck my eye happened <lb/>
to light on the bread-barge and beef-kid, which contained the <lb/>
remnants of our last hasty meal. Although I had never before <lb/>
thought of providing anything in the way of food for our <reg orig="expedi-|tion">expedition</reg>, <lb/>
as I fully relied upon the fruits of the island to sustain us <lb/>
wherever we might wander, yet I could not resist the inclination <lb/>
I felt to provide luncheon from the relics before me. <reg orig="Accord-|ingly">Accordingly</reg> <lb/>
I took a double handful of those small, broken, flinty bits <lb/>
of biscuit which generally go by the name of "midshipmen's <lb/>
nuts," and thrust them into the bosom of my frock; in which <lb/>
same ample receptacle I had previously stowed away several <lb/>
pounds of tobacco and a few yards of cotton cloth&mdash;articles with <lb/>
which I intended to purchase the good-will of the natives, as <lb/>
soon as we should appear among them after the departure of our <lb/>
vessel.</p>
<p>This last addition to my stock caused a considerable <reg orig="pro-|tuberance">protuberance</reg> <lb/>
in front, which I abated in a measure by shaking the <lb/>
bits of bread around my waist, and distributing the plugs of <lb/>
tobacco among the folds of the garment.</p>
<p>Hardly had I completed these arrangements when my name <lb/>
was sung out by a dozen voices, and I sprung upon the deck, <lb/>
where I found all the party in the boat, and impatient to shove <lb/>
off. I dropped over the side and seated myself with the rest of <lb/>
the watch in the stern sheets, while the poor larborders shipped <lb/>
their oars, and commenced pulling us ashore.</p>
<p>This happened to be the rainy season at the islands, and the <lb/>
heavens had nearly the whole morning betokened one of those <lb/>
heavy showers which during this period so frequently occur. <lb/>
The large drops fell bubbling into the water shortly after our <lb/>
leaving the ship, and by the time we had effected a landing it <lb/>
poured down in torrents. We fled for shelter under cover of an <lb/>
immense canoe-house which stood hard by the beach, and waited <lb/>
for the first fury of the storm to pass.</p>
<p>It continued, however, without cessation; and the monotonous <lb/>
<pb n="39" entity="z000000574_0066" pid="uva-lib:244518"/>
beating of the rain over head began to exert a drowsy influence <lb/>
upon the men, who, throwing themselves here and there upon <lb/>
the large war-canoes, after chatting awhile, all fell asleep.</p>
<p>This was the opportunity we desired, and Toby and I availed <lb/>
ourselves of it at once by stealing out of the canoe-house and <lb/>
plunging into the depths of an extensive grove that was in its <lb/>
rear. After ten minutes' rapid progress we gained an open space <lb/>
from which we could just descry the ridge we intended to mount <lb/>
looming dimly through the mists of the tropical shower, and <lb/>
distant from us, as we estimated, something more than a mile. <lb/>
Our direct course towards it lay through a rather populous part <lb/>
of the bay; but desirous as we were of evading the natives, and <lb/>
securing an unmolested retreat to the mountains, we determined, <lb/>
by taking a circuit through some extensive thickets, to avoid their <lb/>
vicinity altogether.</p>
<p>The heavy rain that still continued to fall without intermission <lb/>
favoured our enterprise, as it drove the islanders into their houses, <lb/>
and prevented any casual meeting with them. Our heavy frocks <lb/>
soon became completely saturated with water, and by their <lb/>
weight, and that of the articles we had concealed beneath them, <lb/>
not a little impeded our progress. But it was no time to pause <lb/>
when at any moment we might be surprised by a body of the <lb/>
savages, and forced at the very outset to relinquish our <reg orig="under-|taking">undertaking</reg>.</p>
<p>Since leaving the canoe-house we had scarcely exchanged a <lb/>
single syllable with one another; but when we entered a second <lb/>
narrow opening in the wood, and again caught sight of the ridge <lb/>
before us, I took Toby by the arm, and pointing along its sloping <lb/>
outline to the lofty heights at its extremity, said in a low tone, <lb/>
"Now Toby, not a word, nor a glance backward, till we stand <lb/>
on the summit of yonder mountain&mdash;so no more lingering, but <lb/>
let us shove ahead while we can, and in a few hours' time we may <lb/>
laugh aloud.&mdash;You are the lightest and the nimblest, so lead on, <lb/>
and I will follow."</p>
<p>"All right, brother," said Toby, "quick's our play; only let's <lb/>
keep close together, that's all;" and so saying, with a bound like <lb/>
a young roe, he cleared a brook which ran across our path, and <lb/>
rushed forward with a quick step.</p>
<pb n="40" entity="z000000574_0067" pid="uva-lib:244519"/>
<p>When we arrived within a short distance of the ridge, we were <lb/>
stopped by a mass of tall yellow reeds, growing together as <lb/>
thickly as they could stand, and as tough and stubborn as so <lb/>
many rods of steel; and we perceived, to our chagrin, that they <lb/>
extended midway up the elevation we purposed to ascend.</p>
<p>For a moment we gazed about us in quest of a more <reg orig="practi-|cable">practicable</reg> <lb/>
route; it was, however, at once apparent that there was no <lb/>
resource but to pierce this thicket of canes at all hazards. We <lb/>
now reversed our order of march, I, being the heaviest, taking <lb/>
the lead, with a view of breaking a path through the obstruction, <lb/>
while Toby fell into the rear.</p>
<p>Two or three times I endeavoured to insinuate myself between <lb/>
the canes, and by dint of coaxing and bending them to make <lb/>
some progress; but a bull-frog might as well have tried to work <lb/>
a passage through the teeth of a comb, and I gave up the attempt <lb/>
in despair.</p>
<p>Half wild with meeting an obstacle we had so little <reg orig="antici-|pated">anticipated</reg>, <lb/>
I threw myself desperately against it, crushing to the <lb/>
ground the canes with which I came in contact; and, rising <lb/>
to my feet again, repeated the action with like effect. Twenty <lb/>
minutes of this violent exercise almost exhausted me, but it <lb/>
carried us some way into the thicket; when Toby, who had <lb/>
been reaping the benefit of my labours by following close at <lb/>
my heels, proposed to become pioneer in turn, and accordingly <lb/>
passed ahead with a view of affording me a respite from my <lb/>
exertions. As however with his slight frame he made but bad <lb/>
work of it, I was soon obliged to resume my old place again.</p>
<p>On we toiled, the perspiration starting from our bodies in <lb/>
floods, our limbs torn and lacerated with the splintered fragments <lb/>
of the broken canes, until we had proceeded perhaps as far as the <lb/>
middle of the brake, when suddenly it ceased raining, and the <lb/>
atmosphere around us became close and sultry beyond expression. <lb/>
The elasticity of the reeds, quickly recovering from the <reg orig="tempo-|rary">temporary</reg> <lb/>
pressure of our bodies, caused them to spring back to their <lb/>
original position; so that they closed in upon us as we advanced, <lb/>
and prevented the circulation of the little air which might <lb/>
otherwise have reached us. Besides this, their great height <lb/>
completely shut us out from the view of surrounding objects, <lb/>
<pb n="41" entity="z000000574_0068" pid="uva-lib:244520"/>
and we were not certain but that we might have been going all <lb/>
the time in a wrong direction.</p>
<p>Fatigued with my long-continued efforts, and panting for <lb/>
breath, I felt myself completely incapacitated for any further <lb/>
exertion. I rolled up the sleeve of my frock, and squeezed the <lb/>
moisture it contained into my parched mouth. But the few <lb/>
drops I managed to obtain gave me little relief, and I sunk down <lb/>
for a moment with a sort of dogged apathy, from which I was <lb/>
aroused by Toby, who had devised a plan to free us from the net <lb/>
in which we had become entangled.</p>
<p>He was laying about him lustily with his sheath-knife, lopping <lb/>
the canes right and left, like a reaper, and soon made quite a <lb/>
clearing around us. This sight reanimated me, and seizing my <lb/>
own knife, I hacked and hewed away without mercy. But alas! <lb/>
the farther we advanced, the thicker and taller, and apparently <lb/>
the more interminable, the reeds became.</p>
<p>I began to think we were fairly snared, and had almost made <lb/>
up my mind that without a pair of wings we should never be <lb/>
able to escape from the toils; when all at once I discerned a <lb/>
peep of daylight through the canes on my right, and, <reg orig="communi-|cating">communicating</reg> <lb/>
the joyful tidings to Toby, we both fell to with fresh <lb/>
spirit, and speedily opening a passage towards it we found <reg orig="our-|selves">ourselves</reg> <lb/>
clear of perplexities, and in the near vicinity of the ridge.</p>
<p>After resting for a few moments we began the ascent, and <lb/>
after a little vigorous climbing found ourselves close to its <lb/>
summit. Instead however of walking along its ridge, where we <lb/>
should have been in full view of the natives in the vales beneath, <lb/>
and at a point where they could easily intercept us were they so <lb/>
inclined, we cautiously advanced on one side, crawling on our <lb/>
hands and knees, and screened from observation by the grass <lb/>
through which we glided, much in the fashion of a couple of <lb/>
serpents. After an hour employed in this unpleasant kind of <lb/>
locomotion, we started to our feet again and pursued our way <lb/>
boldly along the crest of the ridge.</p>
<p>This salient spur of the lofty elevations that encompassed the <lb/>
bay rose with a sharp angle from the valleys at its base, and <lb/>
presented, with the exception of a few steep acclivities, the <reg orig="ap-|pearance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
of a vast inclined plane, sweeping down towards the <lb/>
<pb n="42" entity="z000000574_0069" pid="uva-lib:244521"/>
sea from the heights in the distance. We had ascended it near <lb/>
the place of its termination and at its lowest point, and now saw <lb/>
our route to the mountains distinctly defined along its narrow <lb/>
crest, which was covered with a soft carpet of verdure, and was <lb/>
in many parts only a few feet wide.</p>
<p>Elated with the success which had so far attended our <reg orig="enter-|prise">enterprise</reg>, <lb/>
and invigorated by the refreshing atmosphere we now <lb/>
inhaled, Toby and I in high spirits were making our way rapidly <lb/>
along the ridge, when suddenly from the valleys below which lay <lb/>
on either side of us we heard the distant shouts of the natives, <lb/>
who had just descried us, and to whom our figures, brought in <lb/>
bold relief against the sky, were plainly revealed.</p>
<p>Glancing our eyes into these valleys, we perceived their savage <lb/>
inhabitants hurrying to and fro, seemingly under the influence <lb/>
of some sudden alarm, and appearing to the eye scarcely bigger <lb/>
than so many pigmies; while their white thatched dwellings, <lb/>
dwarfed by the distance, looked like baby-houses. As we looked <lb/>
down upon the islanders from our lofty elevation, we experienced <lb/>
a sense of security; feeling confident that, should they undertake <lb/>
a pursuit, it would, from the start we now had, prove entirely <lb/>
fruitless, unless they followed us into the mountains, where we <lb/>
knew they cared not to venture.</p>
<p>However, we thought it as well to make the most of our time; <lb/>
and accordingly, where the ground would admit of it, we ran <lb/>
swiftly along the summit of the ridge, until we were brought to <lb/>
a stand by a steep cliff, which at first seemed to interpose an <lb/>
effectual barrier to our further advance. By dint of much hard <lb/>
scrambling however, and at some risk to our necks, we at last <lb/>
surmounted it, and continued our flight with unabated celerity.</p>
<p>We had left the beach early in the morning, and after an <reg orig="un-|interrupted">uninterrupted</reg>, <lb/>
though at times difficult and dangerous ascent, <lb/>
during which we had never once turned our faces to the sea, we <lb/>
found ourselves, about three hours before sunset, standing on the <lb/>
top of what seemed to be the highest land on the island, an <reg orig="im-|mense">immense</reg> <lb/>
overhanging cliff composed of basaltic rocks, hung round <lb/>
with parasitical plants. We must have been more than three <lb/>
thousand feet above the level of the sea, and the scenery viewed <lb/>
from this height was magnificent.</p>
<pb n="43" entity="z000000574_0070" pid="uva-lib:244522"/>
<p>The lonely bay of Nukuheva, dotted here and there with the <lb/>
black hulls of the vessels composing the French squadron, lay <lb/>
reposing at the base of a circular range of elevations, whose <lb/>
verdant sides, perforated with deep glens or diversified with <lb/>
smiling valleys, formed altogether the loveliest view I ever <reg orig="be-|held">beheld</reg>, <lb/>
and were I to live a hundred years, I should never forget <lb/>
the feeling of admiration which I then experienced.</p>

</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">My</hi> curiosity had been not a little raised with regard to the <lb/>
description of country we should meet on the other side of the <lb/>
mountains; and I had supposed, with Toby, that immediately on <lb/>
gaining the heights we should be enabled to view the large bays <lb/>
of Happar and Typee reposing at our feet on one side, in the <lb/>
same way that Nukuheva lay spread out below on the other. <lb/>
But here we were disappointed. Instead of finding the mountain <lb/>
we had ascended sweeping down in the opposite direction into <lb/>
broad and capacious valleys, the land appeared to retain its <lb/>
general elevation, only broken into a series of ridges and <reg orig="inter-|vales">intervales</reg>, <lb/>
which as far as the eye could reach stretched away from <lb/>
us, with their precipitous sides covered with the brightest <reg orig="ver-|dure">verdure</reg>, <lb/>
and waving here and there with the foliage of clumps of <lb/>
woodland; among which, however, we perceived none of those <lb/>
trees upon whose fruit we had relied with such certainty.</p>
<p>This was a most unlooked-for discovery, and one that promised <lb/>
to defeat our plans altogether, for we could not think of <reg orig="descend-|ing">descending</reg> <lb/>
the mountain on the Nukuheva side in quest of food. Should <lb/>
we for this purpose be induced to retrace our steps, we should <lb/>
run no small chance of encountering the natives, who in that <lb/>
case, if they did nothing worse to us, would be certain to convey <lb/>
us back to the ship for the sake of the reward in calico and <lb/>
trinkets, which we had no doubt our skipper would hold out to <lb/>
them as an inducement to our capture.</p>
<p>What was to be done? The Dolly would not sail perhaps <lb/>
for ten days, and how were we to sustain life during this period? <lb/>
I bitterly repented our improvidence in not providing ourselves, <lb/>
as we easily might have done, with a supply of biscuit. With a <lb/>
<pb n="45" entity="z000000574_0072" pid="uva-lib:244524"/>
rueful visage I now bethought me of the scanty handful of bread <lb/>
I had stuffed into the bosom of my frock, and felt somewhat <lb/>
desirous to ascertain what part of it had weathered the rather <lb/>
rough usage it had experienced in ascending the mountain. I <lb/>
accordingly proposed to Toby that we should enter into a joint <lb/>
examination of the various articles we had brought from the ship. <lb/>
With this intent we seated ourselves upon the grass; and a little <lb/>
curious to see with what kind of judgment my companion had <lb/>
filled his frock&mdash;which I remarked seemed about as well lined as <lb/>
my own&mdash;I requested him to commence operations by spreading <lb/>
out its contents.</p>
<p>Thrusting his hand, then, into the bosom of this capacious <lb/>
receptacle, he first brought to light about a pound of tobacco, <lb/>
whose component parts still adhered together, the whole outside <lb/>
being covered with soft particles of sea-bread. Wet and dripping, <lb/>
it had the appearance of having been just recovered from the <lb/>
bottom of the sea. But I paid slight attention to a substance of <lb/>
so little value to us in our present situation, as soon as I perceived <lb/>
the indications it gave of Toby's foresight in laying in a supply <lb/>
of food for the expedition.</p>
<p>I eagerly inquired what quantity he had brought with him, <lb/>
when, rummaging once more beneath his garment, he produced <lb/>
a small handful of something so soft, pulpy, and discoloured, that <lb/>
for a few moments he was as much puzzled as myself to tell by <lb/>
what possible instrumentality such a villainous compound had <lb/>
become engendered in his bosom. I can only describe it as a <lb/>
hash of soaked bread and bits of tobacco, brought to a doughy <lb/>
consistency by the united agency of perspiration and rain. But <lb/>
repulsive as it might otherwise have been, I now regarded it as <lb/>
an invaluable treasure, and proceeded with great care to transfer <lb/>
this paste-like mass to a large leaf which I had plucked from a <lb/>
bush beside me. Toby informed me that in the morning he had <lb/>
placed two whole biscuits in his bosom, with a view of munching <lb/>
them, should he feel so inclined, during our flight. These were <lb/>
now reduced to the equivocal substance which I had just placed <lb/>
on the leaf.</p>
<p>Another dive into the frock brought to view some four or five <lb/>
yards of calico print, whose tasteful pattern was rather disfigured <lb/>
by the yellow stains of the tobacco with which it had been <lb/>
<pb n="46" entity="z000000574_0073" pid="uva-lib:244525"/>
brought in contact. In drawing this calico slowly from his <lb/>
bosom inch by inch, Toby reminded me of a juggler performing <lb/>
the feat of the endless ribbon. The next cast was a small one, <lb/>
being a sailor's little "ditty-bag," containing needles, thread, and <lb/>
other sewing utensils; then came a razor-case, followed by two <lb/>
or three separate plugs of negro-head, which were fished up from <lb/>
the bottom of the now empty receptacle. These various matters <lb/>
being inspected, I produced the few things that I had myself <lb/>
brought.</p>
<p>As might have been anticipated from the state of my <reg orig="com-|panion's">companion's</reg> <lb/>
edible supplies, I found my own in a deplorable condition, <lb/>
and diminished to a quantity that would not have formed half a <lb/>
dozen mouthfuls for a hungry man who was partial enough to <lb/>
tobacco not to mind swallowing it. A few morsels of bread, <lb/>
with a fathom or two of white cotton cloth, and several pounds <lb/>
of choice pigtail, composed the extent of my possessions.</p>
<p>Our joint stock of miscellaneous articles was now made up <lb/>
into a compact bundle, which it was agreed we should carry <lb/>
alternately. But the sorry remains of the biscuit were not to be <lb/>
disposed of so summarily: the precarious circumstances in which <lb/>
we were placed made us regard them as something on which very <lb/>
probably depended the fate of our adventure. After a brief <reg orig="dis-|cussion">discussion</reg>, <lb/>
in which we both of us expressed our resolution of not <lb/>
descending into the bay until the ship's departure, I suggested to <lb/>
my companion that little of it as there was, we should divide the <lb/>
bread into six equal portions, each of which should be a day's <lb/>
allowance for both of us. This proposition he assented to; so I <lb/>
took the silk kerchief from my neck, and cutting it with my <lb/>
knife into half a dozen equal pieces, proceeded to make an exact <lb/>
division.</p>
<p>At first, Toby, with a degree of fastidiousness that seemed to <lb/>
me ill-timed, was for picking out the minute particles of tobacco <lb/>
with which the spongy mass was mixed; but against this <reg orig="pro-|ceeding">proceeding</reg> <lb/>
I protested, as by such an operation we must have greatly <lb/>
diminished its quantity.</p>
<p>When the division was accomplished, we found that a day's <lb/>
allowance for the two was not a great deal more than what a <lb/>
table-spoon might hold. Each separate portion we immediately <lb/>
rolled up in the bit of silk prepared for it, and joining them <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="z000000574_0074" pid="uva-lib:244526"/>
altogether into a small package, I committed them, with solemn <lb/>
injunctions of fidelity, to the custody of Toby. For the remainder <lb/>
of that day we resolved to fast, as we had been fortified by a <lb/>
breakfast in the morning; and now starting again to our feet, <lb/>
we looked about us for a shelter during the night, which, from <lb/>
the appearance of the heavens, promised to be a dark and <reg orig="tem-|pestuous">tempestuous</reg> <lb/>
one.</p>
<p>There was no place near us which would in any way answer <lb/>
our purpose; so turning our backs upon Nukuheva, we <reg orig="com-|menced">commenced</reg> <lb/>
exploring the unknown regions which lay upon the <lb/>
other side of the mountain.</p>
<p>In this direction, as far as our vision extended, not a sign of <lb/>
life, nor anything that denoted even the transient residence of <lb/>
man, could be seen. The whole landscape seemed one unbroken <lb/>
solitude, the interior of the island having apparently been <reg orig="un-|tenanted">untenanted</reg> <lb/>
since the morning of the creation; and as we advanced <lb/>
through this wilderness, our voices sounded strangely in our <lb/>
ears, as though human accents had never before disturbed the <lb/>
fearful silence of the place, interrupted only by the low <reg orig="mur-|murings">murmurings</reg> <lb/>
of distant waterfalls.</p>
<p>Our disappointment, however, in not finding the various <lb/>
fruits with which we had intended to regale ourselves during <lb/>
our stay in these wilds, was a good deal lessened by the <reg orig="consi-|deration">consideration</reg> <lb/>
that from this very circumstance we should be much <lb/>
less exposed to a casual meeting with the savage tribes about us, <lb/>
who we knew always dwelt beneath the shadows of those trees <lb/>
which supplied them with food.</p>
<p>We wandered along, casting eager glances into every bush we <lb/>
passed, until just as we had succeeded in mounting one of the <lb/>
many ridges that intersected the ground, I saw in the grass <lb/>
before me something like an indistinctly traced footpath, which <lb/>
appeared to lead along the top of the ridge, and to descend with <lb/>
it into a deep ravine about half a mile in advance of us.</p>
<p>Robinson Crusoe could not have been more startled at the <lb/>
footprint in the sand than we were at this unwelcome discovery. <lb/>
My first impulse was to make as rapid a retreat as possible, and <lb/>
bend our steps in some other direction; but our curiosity to see <lb/>
whither this path might lead, prompted us to pursue it. So on <lb/>
we went, the track becoming more and more visible the farther <lb/>
<pb n="48" entity="z000000574_0075" pid="uva-lib:244527"/>
we proceeded, until it conducted us to the verge of the ravine, <lb/>
where it abruptly terminated.</p>
<p>"And so," said Toby, peering down into the chasm, "every <lb/>
one that travels this path takes a jump here, eh?"</p>
<p>"Not so," said I, "for I think they might manage to descend <lb/>
without it; what say you,&mdash;shall we attempt the feat?"</p>
<p>"And what, in the name of caves and coal-holes, do you expect <lb/>
to find at the bottom of that gulf but a broken neck&mdash;why it <lb/>
looks blacker than our ship's hold, and the roar of those <reg orig="water-|falls">waterfalls</reg> <lb/>
down there would batter one's brains to pieces."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, Toby," I exclaimed, laughing; "but there's <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
to be seen here, that's plain, or there would have been no <lb/>
path, and I am resolved to find out what it is."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">I</hi> will tell you what, my pleasant fellow," rejoined Toby <lb/>
quickly, "if you are going to pry into everything you meet <lb/>
with here that excites your curiosity, you will marvellously soon <lb/>
get knocked on the head; to a dead certainty you will come <lb/>
bang upon a party of these savages in the midst of your <reg orig="discovery-|makings">discoverymakings</reg>, <lb/>
and I doubt whether such an event would particularly <lb/>
delight you. Just take my advice for once, and let us 'bout <lb/>
ship and steer in some other direction; besides, it's getting late, <lb/>
and we ought to be mooring ourselves for the night."</p>
<p>"That is just the thing I have been driving at," replied I; <lb/>
"and I am thinking that this ravine will exactly answer our <lb/>
purpose, for it is roomy, secluded, well watered, and may shelter <lb/>
us from the weather."</p>
<p>"Aye, and from sleep too, and by the same token will give us <lb/>
sore throats and rheumatisms into the bargain," cried Toby, <lb/>
with evident dislike at the idea.</p>
<p>"Oh, very well then, my lad," said I, "since you will not <lb/>
accompany me, here I go alone. You will see me in the <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg>;" <lb/>
and advancing to the edge of the cliff upon which we had <lb/>
been standing, I proceeded to lower myself down by the tangled <lb/>
roots which clustered about all the crevices of the rock. As I <lb/>
had anticipated, Toby, in spite of his previous remonstrances, <lb/>
followed my example, and dropping himself with the activity of <lb/>
a squirrel from point to point, he quickly outstripped me, and <lb/>
effected a landing at the bottom before I had accomplished <reg orig="two-|thirds">two-thirds</reg> <lb/>
of the descent.</p>
<pb n="49" entity="z000000574_0076" pid="uva-lib:244528"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">E</fw></pb>
<p>The sight that now greeted us was one that will ever be <lb/>
vividly impressed upon my mind. Five foaming streams, rushing <lb/>
through as many gorges, and swelled and turbid by the recent <lb/>
rains, united together in one mad plunge of nearly eighty feet, <lb/>
and fell with wild uproar into a deep black pool scooped out of <lb/>
the gloomy-looking rocks that lay piled around, and thence in <lb/>
one collected body dashed down a narrow sloping channel which <lb/>
seemed to penetrate into the very bowels of the earth. Overhead, <lb/>
vast roots of trees hung down from the sides of the ravine <reg orig="drip-|ping">dripping</reg> <lb/>
with moisture, and trembling with the concussions produced <lb/>
by the fall. It was now sunset, and the feeble uncertain light <lb/>
that found its way into these caverns and woody depths heightened <lb/>
their strange appearance, and reminded us that in a short time <lb/>
we should find ourselves in utter darkness.</p>
<p>As soon as I had satisfied my curiosity by gazing at this scene, <lb/>
I fell to wondering how it was that what we had taken for a <lb/>
path should have conducted us to so singular a place, and began <lb/>
to suspect that after all I might have been deceived in supposing <lb/>
it to have been a track formed by the islanders. This was <lb/>
rather an agreeable reflection than otherwise, for it dimiuished <lb/>
our dread of accidentally meeting with any of them, and I came <lb/>
to the conclusion that perhaps we could not have selected a more <lb/>
secure hiding-place than this very spot we had so accidentally <lb/>
hit upon. Toby agreed with me in this view of the matter, and <lb/>
we immediately began gathering together the limbs of trees <lb/>
which lay scattered about, with the view of constructing a <reg orig="tem-|porary">temporary</reg> <lb/>
hut for the night. This we were obliged to build close <lb/>
to the foot of the cataract, for the current of water extended <lb/>
very nearly to the sides of the gorge. The few moments of light <lb/>
that remained we employed in covering our hut with a species of <lb/>
broad-bladed grass that grew in every fissure of the ravine. Our <lb/>
hut, if it deserved to be called one, consisted of six or eight of the <lb/>
straightest branches we could find laid obliquely against the steep <lb/>
wall of rock, with their lower ends within a foot of the stream. <lb/>
Into the space thus covered over we managed to crawl, and <reg orig="dis-|pose">dispose</reg> <lb/>
our wearied bodies as best we could.</p>
<p>Shall I ever forget that horrid night? As for poor Toby, I <lb/>
could scarcely get a word out of him. It would have been some <lb/>
consolation to have heard his voice, but he lay shivering the <lb/>
<pb n="50" entity="z000000574_0077" pid="uva-lib:244529"/>
live-long night like a man afflicted with the palsy, with his knees <lb/>
drawn up to his head, while his back was supported against the <lb/>
dripping side of the rock. During this wretched night there <lb/>
seemed nothing wanting to complete the perfect misery of our <lb/>
condition. The rain descended in such torrents that our poor <lb/>
shelter proved a mere mockery. In vain did I try to elude the <lb/>
incessant streams that poured upon me; by protecting one part <lb/>
I only exposed another, and the water was continually finding <lb/>
some new opening through which to drench us.</p>
<p>I have had many a ducking in the course of my life, and in <lb/>
general care little about; but the accumulated horrors of that <lb/>
night, the deathlike coldness of the place, the appalling <reg orig="dark-|ness">darkness</reg> <lb/>
and the dismal sense of our forlorn condition, almost <reg orig="un-|manned">unmanned</reg> <lb/>
me.</p>
<p>It will not be doubted that the next morning we were early <lb/>
risers, and as soon as I could catch the faintest glimpse of <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
like daylight I shook my companion by the arm, and told <lb/>
him it was sunrise. Poor Toby lifted up his head, and after <lb/>
a moment's pause said, in a husky voice, "Then, shipmate, my <lb/>
toplights have gone out, for it appears darker now with my <lb/>
eyes open than it did when they were shut."</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed I; "you are not awake yet."</p>
<p>"Awake!" roared Toby in a rage, "awake! You mean to <lb/>
insinuate I've been asleep, do you? It is an insult to a man <lb/>
to suppose he could sleep in such an infernal place as this."</p>
<p>By the time I had apologized to my friend for having <reg orig="mis-|construed">misconstrued</reg> <lb/>
his silence, it had become somewhat more light, and <lb/>
we crawled out of our lair. The rain had ceased, but everything <lb/>
around us was dripping with moisture. We stripped off our <lb/>
saturated garments, and wrung them as dry as we could. We <lb/>
contrived to make the blood circulate in our benumbed limbs by <lb/>
rubbing them vigorously with our hands; and after performing <lb/>
our ablutions in the stream, and putting on our still wet clothes, <lb/>
we began to think it advisable to break our long fast, it being <lb/>
now twenty-four hours since we had tasted food.</p>
<p>Accordingly our day's ration was brought out, and seating <lb/>
ourselves on a detached fragment of rock, we proceeded to <reg orig="dis-|cuss">discuss</reg> <lb/>
it. First we divided it into two equal portions, and <reg orig="care-|fully">carefully</reg> <lb/>
rolling one of them up for our evening's repast, divided <lb/>
<pb n="51" entity="z000000574_0078" pid="uva-lib:244530"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">E 2</fw></pb>
the remainder again as equally as possible, and then drew lots <lb/>
for the first choice. I could have placed the morsel that fell to <lb/>
my share upon the tip of my finger; but notwithstanding this I <lb/>
took care that it should be full ten minutes before I had <reg orig="swal-|lowed">swallowed</reg> <lb/>
the last crumb. What a true saying it is that "appetite <lb/>
furnishes the best sauce." There was a flavour and a relish to <lb/>
this small particle of food that under other circumstances it <lb/>
would have been impossible for the most delicate viands to have <lb/>
imparted. A copious draught of the pure water which flowed <lb/>
at our feet served to complete the meal, and after it we rose <reg orig="sen-|sibly">sensibly</reg> <lb/>
refreshed, and prepared for whatever might befall us.</p>
<p>We now carefully examined the chasm in which we had <lb/>
passed the night. We crossed the stream, and gaining the <lb/>
farther side of the pool I have mentioned, discovered proofs <lb/>
that the spot must have been visited by some one but a short <lb/>
time previous to our arrival. Further observation convinced us <lb/>
that it had been regularly frequented, and, as we afterwards <reg orig="con-|jectured">conjectured</reg> <lb/>
from particular indications, for the purpose of obtaining <lb/>
a certain root, from which the natives obtain a kind of <reg orig="oint-|ment">ointment</reg>.</p>
<p>These discoveries immediately determined us to abandon a <lb/>
place which had presented no inducement for us to remain, <lb/>
except the promise of security; and as we looked about us for <lb/>
the means of ascending again into the upper regions, we at last <lb/>
found a practicable part of the rock, and half an hour's toil <reg orig="car-|ried">carried</reg> <lb/>
us to the summit of the same cliff from which the preceding <lb/>
evening we had descended.</p>
<p>I now proposed to Toby that instead of rambling about the <lb/>
island, exposing ourselves to discovery at every turn, we should <lb/>
select some place as our fixed abode for as long a period as our <lb/>
food should hold out, build ourselves a comfortable hut, and <lb/>
be as prudent and circumspect as possible. To all this my <lb/>
companion assented, and we at once set about carrying the plan <lb/>
into execution.</p>
<p>With this view, after exploring without success a little glen <lb/>
near us, we crossed several of the ridges of which I have before <lb/>
spoken; and about noon found ourselves ascending a long and <lb/>
gradually rising slope, but still without having discovered any <lb/>
place adapted to our purpose. Low and heavy clouds betokened <lb/>
<pb n="52" entity="z000000574_0079" pid="uva-lib:244531"/>
an approaching storm, and we hurried on to gain a covert in a <lb/>
clump of thick bushes which appeared to terminate the long <lb/>
ascent. We threw ourselves under the lee of these bushes, and <lb/>
pulling up the long grass that grew around, covered ourselves <lb/>
completely with it, and awaited the shower.</p>
<p>But it did not come as soon as we had expected, and before <lb/>
many minutes my companion was fast asleep, and I was rapidly <lb/>
falling into the same state of happy forgetfulness. Just at this <lb/>
juncture, however, down came the rain with a violence that put <lb/>
all thoughts of slumber to flight. Although in some measure <lb/>
sheltered, our clothes soon became as wet as ever: this, after all <lb/>
the trouble we had taken to dry them, was provoking enough: <lb/>
but there was no help for it; and I recommend all adventurous <lb/>
youths who abandon vessels in romantic islands during the rainy <lb/>
season to provide themselves with umbrellas.</p>
<p>After an hour or so the shower passed away. My companion <lb/>
slept through it all, or at least appeared so to do; and now that <lb/>
it was over I had not the heart to awaken him. As I lay on <lb/>
my back completely shrouded with verdure, the leafy branches <lb/>
drooping over me, and my limbs buried in grass, I could not <lb/>
avoid comparing our situation with that of the interesting babes <lb/>
in the wood. Poor little sufferers!&mdash;no wonder their constitutions <lb/>
broke down under the hardships to which they were exposed.</p>
<p>During the hour or two spent under the shelter of these <lb/>
bushes, I began to feel symptoms which I at once attributed to <lb/>
the exposure of the preceding night. Cold shiverings and a <lb/>
burning fever succeeded one another at intervals, while one of <lb/>
my legs was swelled to such a degree, and pained me so acutely, <lb/>
that I half suspected I had been bitten by some venomous <lb/>
reptile, the congenial inhabitant of the chasm from which we <lb/>
had lately emerged. I may here remark by the way&mdash;what I <lb/>
subsequently learned&mdash;that all the islands of Polynesia enjoy the <lb/>
reputation, in common with the Hibernian isle, of being free <lb/>
from the presence of any vipers; though whether Saint Patrick <lb/>
ever visited them, is a question I shall not attempt to decide.</p>
<p>As the feverish sensation increased upon me, I tossed about, <lb/>
still unwilling to disturb my slumbering companion, from whose <lb/>
side I removed two or three yards. I chanced to push aside a <lb/>
branch, and by so doing suddenly disclosed to my view a scene <lb/>
<pb n="53" entity="z000000574_0080" pid="uva-lib:244532"/>
which even now I can recall with all the vividness of the first <lb/>
impression. Had a glimpse of the gardens of Paradise been <lb/>
revealed to me I could scarcely have been more ravished with <lb/>
the sight.</p>
<p>From the spot where I lay transfixed with surprise and delight, <lb/>
I looked straight down into the bosom of a valley, which swept <lb/>
away in long wavy undulations to the blue waters in the distance. <lb/>
Midway towards the sea, and peering here and there amidst the <lb/>
foliage, might be seen the palmetto-thatched houses of its <reg orig="inha-|bitants">inhabitants</reg> <lb/>
glistening in the sun that had bleached them to a dazzling <lb/>
whiteness. The vale was more than three leagues in length, and <lb/>
about a mile across at its greatest width.</p>
<p>On either side it appeared hemmed in by steep and green <reg orig="ac-|clivities">acclivities</reg>, <lb/>
which, uniting near the spot where I lay, formed an <lb/>
abrupt and semicircular termination of grassy cliffs and <reg orig="preci-|pices">precipices</reg> <lb/>
hundreds of feet in height, over which flowed numberless <lb/>
small cascades. But the crowning beauty of the prospect was its <lb/>
universal verdure; and in this indeed consists, I believe, the <reg orig="pecu-|liar">peculiar</reg> <lb/>
charm of every Polynesian landscape. Everywhere below me, <lb/>
from the base of the precipice upon whose very verge I had been <lb/>
unconsciously reposing, the surface of the vale presented a mass <lb/>
of foliage, spread with such rich profusion that it was impossible <lb/>
to determine of what description of trees it consisted.</p>
<p>But perhaps there was nothing about the scenery I beheld <lb/>
more impressive than those silent cascades, whose slender threads <lb/>
of water, after leaping down the steep cliffs, were lost amidst the <lb/>
rich herbage of the valley.</p>
<p>Over all the landscape there reigned the most hushed repose, <lb/>
which I almost feared to break lest, like the enchanted gardens <lb/>
in the fairy tale, a single syllable might dissolve the spell. For <lb/>
a long time, forgetful alike of my own situation, and the vicinity <lb/>
of my still slumbering companion, I remained gazing around <lb/>
me, hardly able to comprehend by what means I had thus <reg orig="sud-|denly">suddenly</reg> <lb/>
been made a spectator of such a scene.</p>

Sufferings&mdash;Disheartening Situation&mdash;A Night in a Ravine&mdash;Morning <lb/>
Meal&mdash;Happy Idea of Toby&mdash;Journey towards the Valley.</hi></p>
</argument>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Recovering</hi> from my astonishment at the beautiful scene before <lb/>
me, I quickly awakened Toby, and informed him of the <reg orig="dis-|covery">discovery</reg> <lb/>
I had made. Together we now repaired to the border <lb/>
of the precipice, and my companion's admiration was equal to <lb/>
my own. A little reflection, however, abated our surprise at <lb/>
coming so unexpectedly upon this valley, since the large vales <lb/>
of Happar and Typee, lying upon this side of Nukuheva, and <lb/>
extending a considerable distance from the sea towards the <reg orig="in-|terior">interior</reg>, <lb/>
must necessarily terminate somewhere about this point.</p>
<p>The question now was as to which of those two places we were <lb/>
looking down upon. Toby insisted that it was the abode of the <lb/>
Happars, and I that it was tenanted by their enemies the <reg orig="fero-|cious">ferocious</reg> <lb/>
Typees. To be sure I was not entirely convinced by my <lb/>
own arguments, but Toby's proposition to descend at once into <lb/>
the valley, and partake of the hospitality of its inmates, seemed <lb/>
to me to be risking so much upon the strength of a mere <reg orig="suppo-|sition">supposition</reg>, <lb/>
that I resolved to oppose it until we had more evidence <lb/>
to proceed upon.</p>
<p>The point was one of vital importance, as the natives of <lb/>
Happar were not only at peace with Nukuheva, but cultivated <lb/>
with its inhabitants the most friendly relations, and enjoyed <lb/>
beside a reputation for gentleness and humanity which led us to <lb/>
expect from them, if not a cordial reception, at least a shelter <lb/>
during the short period we should remain in their territory.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the very name of Typee struck a panic <lb/>
into my heart which I did not attempt to disguise. The <lb/>
thought of voluntarily throwing ourselves into the hands of <lb/>
these cruel savages, seemed to me an act of mere madness; and <lb/>
<pb n="55" entity="z000000574_0082" pid="uva-lib:244534"/>
almost equally so the idea of venturing into the valley, uncertain <lb/>
by which of these two tribes it was inhabited. That the vale at <lb/>
our feet was tenanted by one of them, was a point that appeared <lb/>
to us past all doubt, since we knew that they resided in this <lb/>
quarter, although our information did not enlighten us further.</p>
<p>My companion, however, incapable of resisting the tempting <lb/>
prospect which the place held out of an abundant supply of food <lb/>
and other means of enjoyment, still clung to his own <reg orig="inconsi-|derate">inconsiderate</reg> <lb/>
view of the subject, nor could all my reasoning shake it. <lb/>
When I reminded him that it was impossible for either of us to <lb/>
know anything with certainty, and when I dwelt upon the <reg orig="hor-|rible">horrible</reg> <lb/>
fate we should encounter were we rashly to descend into <lb/>
the valley, and discover too late the error we had committed, <lb/>
he replied by detailing all the evils of our present condition, <lb/>
and the sufferings we must undergo should we continue to remain <lb/>
where we then were.</p>
<p>Anxious to draw him away from the subject, if possible&mdash;for <lb/>
I saw that it would be in vain to attempt changing his mind&mdash;I <lb/>
directed his attention to a long bright unwooded tract of land <lb/>
which, sweeping down from the elevations in the interior, <reg orig="de-|scended">descended</reg> <lb/>
into the valley before us. I then suggested to him that <lb/>
beyond this ridge might lie a capacious and untenanted valley, <lb/>
abounding with all manner of delicious fruits; for I had heard <lb/>
that there were several such upon the island, and proposed that <lb/>
we should endeavour to reach it, and if we found our expectations <lb/>
realised we should at once take refuge in it and remain there as <lb/>
long as we pleased.</p>
<p>He acquiesced in the suggestion; and we immediately, <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg>, <lb/>
began surveying the country lying before us, with a view <lb/>
of determining upon the best route for us to pursue; but it <reg orig="pre-|sented">presented</reg> <lb/>
little choice, the whole interval being broken into steep <lb/>
ridges, divided by dark ravines, extending in parallel lines at <lb/>
right angles to our direct course. All these we would be <lb/>
obliged to cross before we could hope to arrive at our <reg orig="desti-|nation">destination</reg>.</p>
<p>A weary journey! But we decided to undertake it, though, <lb/>
for my own part, I felt little prepared to encounter its fatigues, <lb/>
shivering and burning by turns with the ague and fever; for I <lb/>
know not how else to describe the alternate sensations I <reg orig="experi-|enced">experienced</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="56" entity="z000000574_0083" pid="uva-lib:244535"/>
and suffering not a little from the lameness which afflicted <lb/>
me. Added to this was the faintness consequent on our meagre <lb/>
diet&mdash;a calamity in which Toby participated to the same extent <lb/>
as myself.</p>
<p>These circumstances, however, only augmented my anxiety to <lb/>
reach a place which promised us plenty and repose, before I <lb/>
should be reduced to a state which would render me altogether <lb/>
unable to perform the journey. Accordingly we now commenced <lb/>
it by descending the almost perpendicular side of a steep and <lb/>
narrow gorge, bristling with a thick growth of reeds. Here <lb/>
there was but one mode for us to adopt. We seated ourselves <lb/>
upon the ground, and guided our descent by catching at the <lb/>
canes in our path. The velocity with which we thus slid down <lb/>
the side of the ravine soon brought us to a point where we could <lb/>
use our feet, and in a short time we arrived at the edge of the <lb/>
torrent, which rolled impetuously along the bed of the chasm.</p>
<p>After taking a refreshing draught from the water of the <lb/>
stream, we addressed ourselves to a much more difficult <reg orig="under-|taking">undertaking</reg> <lb/>
than the last. Every foot of our late descent had to be <lb/>
regained in ascending the opposite side of the gorge&mdash;an <reg orig="opera-|tion">operation</reg> <lb/>
rendered the less agreeable from the consideration that in <lb/>
these perpendicular episodes we did not progress an hundred <lb/>
yards on our journey. But, ungrateful as the task was, we set <lb/>
about it with exemplary patience, and after a snail-like progress <lb/>
of an hour or more, had scaled perhaps one half of the distance, <lb/>
when the fever which had left me for awhile returned with such <lb/>
violence, and accompanied by so raging a thirst, that it required <lb/>
all the entreaties of Toby to prevent me from losing all the <lb/>
fruits of my late exertion, by precipitating myself madly down <lb/>
the cliffs we had just climbed, in quest of the water which flowed <lb/>
so temptingly at their base. At the moment all my hopes and <lb/>
fears appeared to be merged in this one desire, careless of the <lb/>
consequences that might result from its gratification. I am <lb/>
aware of no feeling, either of pleasure or of pain, that so <reg orig="com-|pletely">completely</reg> <lb/>
deprives one of all power to resist its impulses, as this <lb/>
same raging thirst.</p>
<p>Toby earnestly conjured me to continue the ascent, assuring <lb/>
me that a little more exertion would bring us to the summit, and <lb/>
that then in less than five minutes we should find ourselves at the <lb/>
<pb n="57" entity="z000000574_0084" pid="uva-lib:244536"/>
brink of the stream, which must necessarily flow on the other <lb/>
side of the ridge.</p>
<p>"Do not," he exclaimed, "turn back, now that we have <reg orig="pro-|ceeded">proceeded</reg> <lb/>
thus far; for I tell you that neither of us will have the <lb/>
courage to repeat the attempt, if once more we find ourselves <lb/>
looking up to where we now are from the bottom of these <lb/>
rocks!"</p>
<p>I was not yet so perfectly beside myself as to be heedless of <lb/>
these representations, and therefore toiled on, ineffectually <reg orig="en-|deavouring">endeavouring</reg> <lb/>
to appease the thirst which consumed me, by thinking <lb/>
that in a short time I should be able to gratify it to my heart's <lb/>
content.</p>
<p>At last we gained the top of the second elevation, the loftiest <lb/>
of those I have described as extending in parallel lines between <lb/>
us and the valley we desired to reach. It commanded a view of <lb/>
the whole intervening distance; and, discouraged as I was by <lb/>
other circumstances, this prospect plunged me into the very <lb/>
depths of despair. Nothing but dark and fearful chasms, <reg orig="sepa-|rated">separated</reg> <lb/>
by sharp crested and perpendicular ridges as far as the eye <lb/>
could reach. Could we have stepped from summit to summit of <lb/>
these steep but narrow elevations we could easily have <reg orig="accom-|plished">accomplished</reg> <lb/>
the distance; but we must penetrate to the bottom of <lb/>
every yawning gulf, and scale in succession every one of the <lb/>
eminences before us. Even Toby, although not suffering as I <lb/>
did, was not proof against the disheartening influences of the <lb/>
sight.</p>
<p>But we did not long stand to contemplate it, impatient as I <lb/>
was to reach the waters of the torrent which flowed beneath us. <lb/>
With an insensibility to danger which I cannot call to mind <lb/>
without shuddering, we threw ourselves down the depths of the <lb/>
ravine, startling its savage solitudes with the echoes produced <lb/>
by the falling fragments of rock we every moment dislodged <lb/>
from their places, careless of the insecurity of our footing, and <lb/>
reckless whether the slight roots and twigs we clutched at <reg orig="sus-|tained">sustained</reg> <lb/>
us for the while, or treacherously yielded to our grasp. <lb/>
For my own part, I scarcely knew whether I was helplessly <reg orig="fall-|ing">falling</reg> <lb/>
from the heights above, or whether the fearful rapidity with <lb/>
which I descended was an act of my own volition.</p>
<p>In a few minutes we reached the foot of the gorge, and <reg orig="kneel-|ing">kneeling</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="58" entity="z000000574_0085" pid="uva-lib:244537"/>
upon a small ledge of dripping rocks, I bent over to the <lb/>
stream. What a delicious sensation was I now to experience! <lb/>
I paused for a second to concentrate all my capabilities of <reg orig="en-|joyment">enjoyment</reg>, <lb/>
and then immerged my lips in the clear element before <lb/>
me. Had the apples of Sodom turned to ashes in my mouth, I <lb/>
could not have felt a more startling revulsion. A single drop of <lb/>
the cold fluid seemed to freeze every drop of blood in my body; <lb/>
the fever that had been burning in my veins gave place on the <lb/>
instant to death-like chills, which shook me one after another <lb/>
like so many shocks of electricity, while the perspiration <reg orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg> <lb/>
by my late violent exertions congealed in icy beads upon <lb/>
my forehead. My thirst was gone, and I fairly loathed the <lb/>
water. Starting to my feet, the sight of those dank rocks, oozing <lb/>
forth moisture at every crevice, and the dark stream shooting <lb/>
along its dismal channel, sent fresh chills through my shivering <lb/>
frame, and I felt as uncontrollable a desire to climb up towards <lb/>
the genial sunlight as I before had to descend the ravine.</p>
<p>After two hours' perilous exertions we stood upon the summit <lb/>
of another ridge, and it was with difficulty I could bring myself <lb/>
to believe that we had ever penetrated the black and yawning <lb/>
chasm which then gaped at our feet. Again we gazed upon <lb/>
the prospect which the height commanded, but it was just <lb/>
as depressing as the one which had before met our eyes. I <lb/>
now felt that in our present situation it was in vain for us to <lb/>
think of ever overcoming the obstacles in our way, and I gave <lb/>
up all thoughts of reaching the vale which lay beyond this series <lb/>
of impediments; while at the same time I could not devise any <lb/>
scheme to extricate ourselves from the difficulties in which we <lb/>
were involved.</p>
<p>The remotest idea of returning to Nukuheva, unless assured of <lb/>
our vessel's departure, never once entered my mind, and indeed <lb/>
it was questionable whether we could have succeeded in reaching <lb/>
it, divided as we were from the bay by a distance we could not <lb/>
compute, and perplexed too in our remembrance of localities by <lb/>
our recent wanderings. Besides, it was unendurable the thought <lb/>
of retracing our steps and rendering all our painful exertions of <lb/>
no avail.</p>
<p>There is scarcely anything when a man is in difficulties that <lb/>
he is more disposed to look upon with abhorrence than a <reg orig="right-|about">right-about</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="59" entity="z000000574_0086" pid="uva-lib:244538"/>
retrograde movement&mdash;a systematic going over of the <lb/>
already trodden ground; and especially if he has a love of <lb/>
adventure, such a course appears indescribably repulsive, so long <lb/>
as there remains the least hope to be derived from braving <lb/>
untried difficulties.</p>
<p>It was this feeling that prompted us to descend the opposite <lb/>
side of the elevation we had just scaled, although with what <lb/>
definite object in view it would have been impossible for either <lb/>
of us to tell.</p>
<p>Without exchanging a syllable upon the subject, Toby and <lb/>
myself simultaneously renounced the design which had lured us <lb/>
thus far&mdash;perceiving in each other's countenances that <reg orig="despond-|ing">desponding</reg> <lb/>
expression which speaks more eloquently than words.</p>
<p>Together we stood towards the close of this weary day in the <lb/>
cavity of the third gorge we had entered, wholly incapacitated <lb/>
for any further exertion, until restored to some degree of strength <lb/>
by food and repose.</p>
<p>We seated ourselves upon the least uncomfortable spot we <lb/>
could select, and Toby produced from the bosom of his frock <lb/>
the sacred package. In silence we partook of the small morsel <lb/>
of refreshment that had been left from the morning's repast, and <lb/>
without once proposing to violate the sanctity of our <reg orig="engage-|ment">engagement</reg> <lb/>
with respect to the remainder, we rose to our feet, and <lb/>
proceeded to construct some sort of shelter under which we might <lb/>
obtain the sleep we so greatly needed.</p>
<p>Fortunately the spot was better adapted to our purpose than <lb/>
the one in which we had passed the last wretched night. We <lb/>
cleared away the tall reeds from a small but almost level bit of <lb/>
ground, and twisted them into a low basket-like hut, which we <lb/>
covered with a profusion of long thick leaves, gathered from a <lb/>
tree near at hand. We disposed them thickly all around, <lb/>
reserving only a slight opening that barely permitted us to crawl <lb/>
under the shelter we had thus obtained.</p>
<p>These deep recesses, though protected from the winds that <lb/>
assail the summits of their lofty sides, are damp and chill to a <lb/>
degree that one would hardly anticipate in such a climate; and <lb/>
being unprovided with anything but our woollen frocks and thin <lb/>
duck trousers to resist the cold of the place, we were the more <lb/>
solicitous to render our habitation for the night as comfortable <lb/>
<pb n="60" entity="z000000574_0087" pid="uva-lib:244539"/>
as we could. Accordingly, in addition to what we had already <lb/>
done, we plucked down all the leaves within our reach and threw <lb/>
them in a heap over our little hut, into which we now crept, <lb/>
raking after us a reserved supply to form our couch.</p>
<p>That night nothing but the pain I suffered prevented me from <lb/>
sleeping most refreshingly. As it was, I caught two or three <lb/>
naps, while Toby slept away at my side as soundly as though he <lb/>
had been sandwiched between two Holland sheets. Luckily it <lb/>
did not rain, and we were preserved from the misery which a <lb/>
heavy shower would have occasioned us.</p>
<p>In the morning I was awakened by the sonorous voice of my <lb/>
companion ringing in my ears and bidding me rise. I crawled <lb/>
out from our heap of leaves, and was astonished at the change <lb/>
which a good night's rest had wrought in his appearance. He <lb/>
was as blithe and joyous as a young bird, and was staying the <lb/>
keenness of his morning's appetite by chewing the soft bark of a <lb/>
delicate branch he held in his hand, and he recommended the <lb/>
like to me as an admirable antidote against the gnawings of <lb/>
hunger.</p>
<p>For my own part, though feeling materially better than I had <lb/>
done the preceding evening, I could not look at the limb that <lb/>
had pained me so violently at intervals during the last <reg orig="twenty-|four">twenty-four</reg> <lb/>
hours, without experiencing a sense of alarm that I strove <lb/>
in vain to shake off. Unwilling to disturb the flow of my <reg orig="com-|rade's">comrade's</reg> <lb/>
spirits, I managed to stifle the complaints to which I might <lb/>
otherwise have given vent, and calling upon him good-humouredly <lb/>
to speed our banquet, I prepared myself for it by washing in the <lb/>
stream. This operation concluded, we swallowed, or rather <lb/>
absorbed, by a peculiar kind of slow sucking process, our <lb/>
respective morsels of nourishment, and then entered into a <lb/>
discussion as to the steps it was necessary for us to pursue.</p>
<p>"What's to be done now?" inquired I, rather dolefully.</p>
<p>"Descend into that same valley we descried yesterday," <lb/>
rejoined Toby, with a rapidity and loudness of utterance that <lb/>
almost led me to suspect he had been slyly devouring the <reg orig="broad-|side">broadside</reg> <lb/>
of an ox in some of the adjoining thickets. "What else," <lb/>
he continued, "remains for us to do but that, to be sure? Why, <lb/>
we shall both starve to a certainty if we remain here; and as to <lb/>
your fears of those Typees&mdash;depend upon it, it is all nonsense.</p>
<pb n="61" entity="z000000574_0088" pid="uva-lib:244540"/>
<p>"It is impossible that the inhabitants of such a lovely place <lb/>
as we saw can be anything else but good fellows; and if you <lb/>
choose rather to perish with hunger in one of these soppy <lb/>
caverns, I for one prefer to chance a bold descent into the valley, <lb/>
and risk the consequences."</p>
<p>"And who is to pilot us thither," I asked, "even if we should <lb/>
decide upon the measure you propose? Are we to go again up <lb/>
and down those precipices that we crossed yesterday, until we <lb/>
reach the place we started from, and then take a flying leap from <lb/>
the cliffs to the valley?"</p>
<p>"'Faith, I didn't think of that," said Toby; "sure enough, <lb/>
both sides of the valley appeared to be hemmed in by precipices, <lb/>
didn't they?"</p>
<p>"Yes," answered I, "as steep as the sides of a line-of-battle <lb/>
ship, and about a hundred times as high." My companion sank <lb/>
his head upon his breast and remained for a while in deep <lb/>
thought. Suddenly he sprang to his feet, while his eyes lighted <lb/>
up with that gleam of intelligence that marks the presence of <lb/>
some bright idea.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," he exclaimed; "the streams all run in the same <lb/>
direction, and must necessarily flow into the valley before they <lb/>
reach the sea; all we have to do is just to follow this stream, <lb/>
and sooner or later it will lead us into the vale."</p>
<p>"You are right, Toby," I exclaimed, "you are right; it <lb/>
must conduct us thither, and quickly too; for, see with what a <lb/>
steep inclination the water descends."</p>
<p>"It does, indeed," burst forth my companion, overjoyed at <lb/>
my verification of his theory, "it does indeed; why, it is as <lb/>
plain as a pike-staff. Let us proceed at once; come, throw away <lb/>
all those stupid ideas about the Typees, and hurrah for the lovely <lb/>
valley of the Happars!"</p>
<p>"You will have it to be Happar, I see, my dear fellow; pray <lb/>
Heaven you may not find yourself deceived," observed I, with a <lb/>
shake of my head.</p>
<p>"Amen to all that, and much more," shouted Toby, rushing <lb/>
forward; "but Happar it is, for nothing else than Happar can <lb/>
it be. So glorious a valley&mdash;such forests of bread-fruit trees&mdash; <lb/>
such groves of cocoa-nut&mdash;such wildernesses of guava-bushes! <lb/>
Ah, shipmate! don't linger behind: in the name of all delightful <lb/>
<pb n="62" entity="z000000574_0089" pid="uva-lib:244541"/>
fruits, I am dying to be at them. Come on, come on; shove <lb/>
ahead, there's a lively lad; never mind the rocks; kick them <lb/>
out of the way, as I do; and to-morrow, old fellow, take my <lb/>
word for it, we shall be in clover. Come on;" and so saying, <lb/>
he dashed along the ravine like a madman, forgetting my <reg orig="in-|ability">inability</reg> <lb/>
to keep up with him. In a few minutes, however, the <lb/>
exuberance of his spirits abated, and, pausing for a while, he <lb/>
permitted me to overtake him.</p>

</argument>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> fearless confidence of Toby was contagious, and I began to <lb/>
adopt the Happar side of the question. I could not, however, <lb/>
overcome a certain feeling of trepidation as we made our way <lb/>
along these gloomy solitudes. Our progress, at first <reg orig="compara-|tively">comparatively</reg> <lb/>
easy, became more and more difficult. The bed of the <lb/>
watercourse was covered with fragments of broken rocks, which <lb/>
had fallen from above, offering so many obstructions to the <lb/>
course of the rapid stream, which vexed and fretted about them, <lb/>
&mdash;forming at intervals small waterfalls, pouring over into deep <lb/>
basins, or splashing wildly upon heaps of stones.</p>
<p>From the narrowness of the gorge, and the steepness of its <lb/>
sides, there was no mode of advancing but by wading through <lb/>
the water; stumbling every moment over the impediments which <lb/>
lay hidden under its surface, or tripping against the huge roots <lb/>
of trees. But the most annoying hindrance we encountered was <lb/>
from a multitude of crooked boughs, which, shooting out almost <lb/>
horizontally from the sides of the chasm, twisted themselves <lb/>
together in fantastic masses almost to the surface of the stream, <lb/>
affording us no passage except under the low arches which they <lb/>
formed. Under these we were obliged to crawl on our hands <lb/>
and feet, sliding along the oozy surface of the rocks, or slipping <lb/>
into the deep pools, and with scarce light enough to guide us. <lb/>
Occasionally we would strike our heads against some projecting <lb/>
limb of a tree; and while imprudently engaged in rubbing the <lb/>
injured part, would fall sprawling amongst flinty fragments, <lb/>
cutting and bruising ourselves, whilst the unpitying waters flowed <lb/>
over our prostrate bodies. Belzoni, worming himself through <lb/>
the subterranean passages of the Egyptian catacombs, could not <lb/>
have met with greater impediments than those we here <reg orig="encoun-|tered">encountered</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="z000000574_0091" pid="uva-lib:244543"/>
But we struggled against them manfully, well knowing <lb/>
our only hope lay in advancing.</p>
<p>Towards sunset we halted at a spot where we made <reg orig="prepara-|tions">preparations</reg> <lb/>
for passing the night. Here we constructed a hut, in much <lb/>
the same way as before, and crawling into it, endeavoured to <lb/>
forget our sufferings. My companion, I believe, slept pretty <lb/>
soundly; but at daybreak, when we rolled out of our dwelling, <lb/>
I felt nearly disqualified for any further efforts. Toby <reg orig="pre-|scribed">prescribed</reg> <lb/>
as a remedy for my illness the contents of one of our <lb/>
little silk packages, to be taken at once in a single dose. To <lb/>
this species of medical treatment, however, I would by no means <lb/>
accede, much as he insisted upon it; and so we partook of our <lb/>
usual morsel, and silently resumed our journey. It was now the <lb/>
fourth day since we left Nukuheva, and the gnawings of hunger <lb/>
became painfully acute. We were fain to pacify them by <reg orig="chew-|ing">chewing</reg> <lb/>
the tender bark of roots and twigs, which, if they did not <lb/>
afford us nourishment, were at least sweet and pleasant to the <lb/>
taste.</p>
<p>Our progress along the steep watercourse was necessarily slow, <lb/>
and by noon we had not advanced more than a mile. It was <lb/>
somewhere near this part of the day that the noise of falling <lb/>
waters, which we had faintly caught in the early morning, <lb/>
became more distinct; and it was not long before we were <lb/>
arrested by a rocky precipice of nearly a hundred feet in depth, <lb/>
that extended all across the channel, and over which the wild <lb/>
stream poured in an unbroken leap. On either hand the walls <lb/>
of the ravine presented their overhanging sides both above and <lb/>
below the fall, affording no means whatever of avoiding the <lb/>
cataract by taking a circuit round it.</p>
<p>"What's to be done now, Toby?" said I.</p>
<p>"Why," rejoined he, "as we cannot retreat, I suppose we <lb/>
must keep shoving along."</p>
<p>"Very true, my dear Toby; but how do you purpose <reg orig="accom-|plishing">accomplishing</reg> <lb/>
that desirable object?"</p>
<p>"By jumping from the top of the fall, if there be no other <lb/>
way," unhesitatingly replied my companion: "it will be much <lb/>
the quickest way of descent; but as you are not quite as active <lb/>
as I am, we will try some other way."</p>
<p>And, so saying, he crept cautiously along and peered over <lb/>
<pb n="65" entity="z000000574_0092" pid="uva-lib:244544"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">F</fw></pb>
into the abyss, while I remained wondering by what possible <lb/>
means we could overcome this apparently insuperable obstruction. <lb/>
As soon as my companion had completed his survey, I eagerly <lb/>
inquired the result.</p>
<p>"The result of my observations you wish to know, do you?" <lb/>
began Toby, deliberately, with one of his odd looks: "well, my <lb/>
lad, the result of my observations is very quickly imparted. It <lb/>
is at present uncertain which of our two necks will have the <lb/>
honour to be broken first; but about a hundred to one would be <lb/>
a fair bet in favour of the man who takes the first jump."</p>
<p>"Then it is an impossible thing, is it?" inquired I, gloomily.</p>
<p>"No, shipmate; on the contrary, it is the easiest thing in life: <lb/>
the only awkward point is the sort of usage which our unhappy <lb/>
limbs may receive when we arrive at the bottom, and what sort <lb/>
of travelling trim we shall be in afterwards. But follow me now, <lb/>
and I will show you the only chance we have.</p>
<p>With this he conducted me to the verge of the cataract, and <lb/>
pointed along the side of the ravine to a number of curious <lb/>
looking roots, some three or four inches in thickness, and <lb/>
several feet long, which after twisting among the fissures of the <lb/>
rock, shot perpendicularly from it and ran tapering to a point <lb/>
in the air, hanging over the gulf like so many dark icicles. <lb/>
They covered nearly the entire surface of one side of the gorge, <lb/>
the lowest of them reaching even to the water. Many were <lb/>
moss-grown and decayed, with their extremities snapped short <lb/>
off, and those in the immediate vicinity of the fall were slippery <lb/>
with moisture.</p>
<p>Toby's scheme, and it was a desperate one, was to intrust <lb/>
ourselves to these treacherous-looking roots, and by slipping <lb/>
down from one to another to gain the bottom.</p>
<p>"Are you ready to venture it?" asked Toby, looking at me <lb/>
earnestly, but without saying a word as to the practicability of <lb/>
the plan.</p>
<p>"I am," was my reply; for I saw it was our only resource if <lb/>
we wished to advance, and as for retreating, all thoughts of that <lb/>
sort had been long abandoned.</p>
<p>After I had signified my assent, Toby, without uttering a <lb/>
single word, crawled along the dripping ledge until he gained a <lb/>
point from whence he could just reach one of the largest of the <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="z000000574_0093" pid="uva-lib:244545"/>
pendant roots; he shook it&mdash;it quivered in his grasp, and when <lb/>
he let it go it twanged in the air like a strong wire sharply <lb/>
struck. Satisfied by his scrutiny, my light-limbed companion <lb/>
swung himself nimbly upon it, and twisting his legs round it in <lb/>
sailor fashion, slipped down eight or ten feet, where his weight <lb/>
gave it a motion not unlike that of a pendulum. He could not <lb/>
venture to descend any further; so holding on with one hand, <lb/>
he with the other shook one by one all the slender roots around <lb/>
him, and at last, finding one which he thought trustworthy, <lb/>
shifted himself to it and continued his downward progress.</p>
<p>So far so well; but I could not avoid comparing my heavier <lb/>
frame and disabled condition with his light figure and <reg orig="remark-|able">remarkable</reg> <lb/>
activity; but there was no help for it, and in less than a <lb/>
minute's time I was swinging directly over his head. As soon <lb/>
as his upturned eyes caught a glimpse of me, he exclaimed in <lb/>
his usual dry tone, for the danger did not seem to daunt him in <lb/>
the least, "Mate, do me the kindness not to fall until I get <lb/>
out of your way;" and then swinging himself more on one side, <lb/>
he continued his descent. In the mean time I cautiously <reg orig="trans-|ferred">transferred</reg> <lb/>
myself from the limb down which I had been slipping to <lb/>
a couple of others that were near it, deeming two strings to my <lb/>
bow better than one, and taking care to test their strength before <lb/>
I trusted my weight to them.</p>
<p>On arriving towards the end of the second stage in this <reg orig="ver-|tical">vertical</reg> <lb/>
journey, and shaking the long roots which were round me, <lb/>
to my consternation they snapped off one after another like so <lb/>
many pipe stems, and fell in fragments against the side of the <lb/>
gulf, splashing at last into the waters beneath.</p>
<p>As one after another the treacherous roots yielded to my grasp, <lb/>
and fell into the torrent, my heart sunk within me. The <lb/>
branches on which I was suspended over the yawning chasm <lb/>
swang to and fro in the air, and I expected them every moment <lb/>
to snap in twain. Appalled at the dreadful fate that menaced <lb/>
me, I clutched frantically at the only large root which remained <lb/>
near me, but in vain; I could not reach it, though my fingers <lb/>
were within a few inches of it. Again and again I tried to <lb/>
reach it, until at length, maddened with the thought of my <lb/>
situation, I swayed myself violently by striking my foot against <lb/>
the side of the rock, and at the instant that I approached the <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="z000000574_0094" pid="uva-lib:244546"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">F 2</fw></pb>
large root caught desperately at it, and transferred myself to it. <lb/>
It vibrated violently under the sudden weight, but fortunately <lb/>
did not give way.</p>
<p>My brain grew dizzy with the idea of the frightful risk I had <lb/>
just run, and I involuntarily closed my eyes to shut out the <lb/>
view of the depth beneath me. For the instant I was safe, and <lb/>
I uttered a devout ejaculation of thanksgiving for my escape.</p>
<p>"Pretty well done," shouted Toby underneath me; "you are <lb/>
nimbler than I thought you to be&mdash;hopping about up there <lb/>
from root to root like any young squirrel. As soon as you have <lb/>
diverted yourself sufficiently, I would advise you to proceed."</p>
<p>"Aye aye, Toby, all in good time: two or three more such <lb/>
famous roots as this, and I shall be with you."</p>
<p>The residue of my downward progress was comparatively easy; <lb/>
the roots were in greater abundance, and in one or two places <lb/>
jutting out points of rock assisted me greatly. In a few moments <lb/>
I was standing by the side of my companion.</p>
<p>Substituting a stout stick for the one I had thrown aside at <lb/>
the top of the precipice, we now continued our course along the <lb/>
bed of the ravine. Soon we were saluted by a sound in advance, <lb/>
that grew by degrees louder and louder, as the noise of the <lb/>
cataract we were leaving behind gradually died on our ears.</p>
<p>"Another precipice for us, Toby."</p>
<p>"Very good; we can descend them, you know&mdash;come on."</p>
<p>Nothing indeed appeared to depress or intimidate this intrepid <lb/>
fellow. Typees or Niagaras, he was as ready to engage one as <lb/>
the other, and I could not avoid a thousand times congratulating <lb/>
myself upon having such a companion in an enterprise like the <lb/>
present.</p>
<p>After an hour's painful progress, we reached the verge of <lb/>
another fall, still loftier than the preceding, and flanked both <lb/>
above and below with the same steep masses of rock, presenting, <lb/>
however, here and there narrow irregular ledges, supporting a <lb/>
shallow soil, on which grew a variety of bushes and trees, whose <lb/>
bright verdure contrasted beautifully with the foamy waters that <lb/>
flowed between them.</p>
<p>Toby, who invariably acted as pioneer, now proceeded to <lb/>
reconnoitre. On his return, he reported that the shelves of rock <lb/>
on our right would enable us to gain with little risk the bottom of <lb/>
<pb n="68" entity="z000000574_0095" pid="uva-lib:244547"/>
the cataract. Accordingly, leaving the bed of the stream at the <lb/>
very point where it thundered down, we began crawling along <lb/>
one of these sloping ledges until it carried us to within a few <lb/>
feet of another that inclined downward at a still sharper angle, <lb/>
and upon which, by assisting each other, we managed to alight <lb/>
in safety. We warily crept along this, steadying ourselves by <lb/>
the naked roots of the shrubs that clung to every fissure. As we <lb/>
proceeded, the narrow path became still more contracted, <reg orig="ren-|dering">rendering</reg> <lb/>
it difficult for us to maintain our footing, until suddenly, <lb/>
as we reached an angle of the wall of rock where we had <reg orig="ex-|pected">expected</reg> <lb/>
it to widen, we perceived to our consternation that a yard <lb/>
or two farther on it abruptly terminated at a place we could not <lb/>
possibly hope to pass.</p>
<p>Toby as usual led the van, and in silence I waited to learn from <lb/>
him how he proposed to extricate us from this new difficulty.</p>
<p>"Well, my boy," I exclaimed, after the expiration of several <lb/>
minutes, during which time my companion had not uttered a <lb/>
word; "what's to be done now?"</p>
<p>He replied in a tranquil tone, that probably the best thing we <lb/>
could do in our present strait was to get out of it as soon as <lb/>
possible.</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear Toby, but tell me <hi rend="italic">how</hi> we are to get out of it."</p>
<p>"Something in this sort of style," he replied; and at the <lb/>
same moment to my horror he slipped sideways off the rock, and <lb/>
as I then thought, by good fortune merely alighted among the <lb/>
spreading branches of a species of palm tree, that shooting its <lb/>
hardy roots along a ledge below, curved its trunk upwards into <lb/>
the air, and presented a thick mass of foliage about twenty feet <lb/>
below the spot where we had thus suddenly been brought to a <lb/>
stand still. I involuntarily held my breath, expecting to see the <lb/>
form of my companion, after being sustained for a moment by <lb/>
the branches of the tree, sink through their frail support, and <lb/>
fall headlong to the bottom. To my surprise and joy, however, <lb/>
he recovered himself, and disentangling his limbs from the <reg orig="frac-|tured">fractured</reg> <lb/>
branches, he peered out from his leafy bed, and shouted <lb/>
lustily, "Come on, my hearty, there is no other alternative!" <lb/>
and with this he ducked beneath the foliage, and slipping down <lb/>
the trunk, stood in a moment at least fifty feet beneath me, upon <lb/>
the broad shelf of rock from which sprung the tree he had <lb/>
descended.</p>
<pb n="69" entity="z000000574_0096" pid="uva-lib:244548"/>
<p>What would I not have given at that moment to have been <lb/>
by his side! The feat he had just accomplished seemed little <lb/>
less than miraculous, and I could hardly credit the evidence of <lb/>
my senses when I saw the wide distance that a single daring act <lb/>
had so suddenly placed between us.</p>
<p>Toby's animating "come on!" again sounded in my ears, <lb/>
and dreading to lose all confidence in myself if I remained <reg orig="me-|ditating">meditating</reg> <lb/>
upon the step, I once more gazed down to assure myself <lb/>
of the relative bearing of the tree and my own position, and then <lb/>
closing my eyes and uttering one comprehensive ejaculation of <lb/>
prayer, I inclined myself over towards the abyss, and after one <lb/>
breathless instant fell with a crash into the tree, the branches <lb/>
snapping and crackling with my weight, as I sunk lower and <lb/>
lower among them, until I was stopped by coming in contact <lb/>
with a sturdy limb.</p>
<p>In a few moments I was standing at the foot of the tree, <reg orig="mani-|pulating">manipulating</reg> <lb/>
myself all over with a view of ascertaining the extent <lb/>
of the injuries I had received. To my surprise the only effects <lb/>
of my feat were a few slight contusions too trifling to care about. <lb/>
The rest of our descent was easily accomplished, and in half an <lb/>
hour after regaining the ravine we had partaken of our evening <lb/>
morsel, built our hut as usual, and crawled under its shelter.</p>
<p>The next morning, in spite of our debility and the agony of <lb/>
hunger under which we were now suffering, though neither of <lb/>
us confessed to the fact, we struggled along our dismal and still <lb/>
difficult and dangerous path, cheered by the hope of soon <reg orig="catch-|ing">catching</reg> <lb/>
a glimpse of the valley before us, and towards evening the <lb/>
voice of a cataract which had for some time sounded like a low <lb/>
deep bass to the music of the smaller waterfalls, broke upon our <lb/>
ears in still louder tones, and assured us that we were <reg orig="approach-|ing">approaching</reg> <lb/>
its vicinity.</p>
<p>That evening we stood on the brink of a precipice, over which <lb/>
the dark stream bounded in one final heap of full 300 feet. The <lb/>
sheer descent terminated in the region we so long had sought. <lb/>
On either side of the fall, two lofty and perpendicular bluffs <lb/>
buttressed the sides of the enormous cliff, and projected into the <lb/>
sea of verdure with which the valley waved, and a range of <lb/>
similar projecting eminences stood disposed in a half circle about <lb/>
the head of the vale. A thick canopy of traces hung over the <lb/>
<pb n="70" entity="z000000574_0097" pid="uva-lib:244549"/>
very verge of the fall, leaving an arched aperture for the passage <lb/>
of the waters, which imparted a strange picturesqueness to the <lb/>
scene.</p>
<p>The valley was now before us; but instead of being conducted <lb/>
into its smiling bosom by the gradual descent of the deep <reg orig="water-|course">watercourse</reg> <lb/>
we had thus far pursued, all our labours now appeared to <lb/>
have been rendered futile by its abrupt termination. But, bitterly <lb/>
disappointed, we did not entirely despair.</p>
<p>As it was now near sunset we determined to pass the night <lb/>
where we were, and on the morrow, refreshed by sleep and <lb/>
by eating at one meal all our stock of food, to accomplish a <lb/>
descent into the valley, or perish in the attempt.</p>
<p>We laid ourselves down that night on a spot, the recollection <lb/>
of which still makes me shudder. A small table of rock which <lb/>
projected over the precipice on one side of the stream, and was <lb/>
drenched by the spray of the fall, sustained a huge trunk of a <lb/>
tree which must have been deposited there by some heavy freshet. <lb/>
It lay obliquely, with one end resting on the rock and the other <lb/>
supported by the side of the ravine. Against it we placed in a <lb/>
sloping direction a number of the half decayed boughs that were <lb/>
strewn about, and covering the whole with twigs and leaves, <lb/>
awaited the morning's light beneath such shelter as it afforded.</p>
<p>During the whole of this night the continual roaring of the <lb/>
cataract&mdash;the dismal moaning of the gale through the trees&mdash;the <lb/>
pattering of the rain, and the profound darkness, affected my <lb/>
spirits to a degree which nothing had ever before produced. Wet, <lb/>
half famished, and chilled to the heart with the dampness of the <lb/>
place, and nearly wild with the pain I endured, I fairly cowered <lb/>
down to the earth under this multiplication of hardships, and <lb/>
abandoned myself to frightful anticipations of evil; and my <lb/>
companion, whose spirit at last was a good deal broken, scarcely <lb/>
uttered a word during the whole night.</p>
<p>At length the day dawned upon us, and rising from our <reg orig="mi-|serable">miserable</reg> <lb/>
pallet, we stretched our stiffened joints, and after eating <lb/>
all that remained of our bread, prepared for the last stage of our <lb/>
journey.</p>
<p>I will not recount every hair breadth escape, and every fearful <lb/>
difficulty that occurred before we succeeded in reaching the <lb/>
bosom of the valley. As I have already described similar scenes, <lb/>
<pb n="71" entity="z000000574_0098" pid="uva-lib:244550"/>
it will be sufficient to say that at length, after great toil and <lb/>
great dangers, we both stood with no limbs broken at the head of <lb/>
that magnificent vale which five days before had so suddenly <lb/>
burst upon my sight, and almost beneath the shadows of <lb/>
those very cliffs from whose summits we had gazed upon the <lb/>
prospect.</p>

</argument>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">How</hi> to obtain the fruit which we felt convinced must grow near <lb/>
at hand was our first thought.</p>
<p>Typee or Happar? A frightful death at the hands of the <lb/>
fiercest of cannibals, or a kindly reception from a gentler race <lb/>
of savages? Which? But it was too late now to discuss a <lb/>
question which would so soon be answered.</p>
<p>The part of the valley in which we found ourselves appeared <lb/>
to be altogether uninhabited. An almost impenetrable thicket <lb/>
extended from side to side, without presenting a single plant <lb/>
affording the nourishment we had confidently calculated upon; <lb/>
and with this object, we followed the course of the stream, <lb/>
casting quick glances as we proceeded into the thick jungles <lb/>
on either hand.</p>
<p>My companion&mdash;to whose solicitations I had yielded in <reg orig="de-|scending">descending</reg> <lb/>
into the valley&mdash;now that the step was taken, began to <lb/>
manifest a degree of caution I had little expected from him. He <lb/>
proposed that, in the event of our finding an adequate supply of <lb/>
fruit, we should remain in this unfrequented portion of the <reg orig="coun-|try&mdash;where">country&mdash;where</reg> <lb/>
we should run little chance of being surprised by its <lb/>
occupants, whoever they might be&mdash;until sufficiently recruited to <lb/>
resume our journey; when laying in a store of food equal to our <lb/>
wants, we might easily regain the bay of Nukuheva, after the <lb/>
lapse of a sufficient interval to ensure the departure of our vessel.</p>
<p>I objected strongly to this proposition, plausible as it was, as <lb/>
the difficulties of the route would be almost insurmountable, <reg orig="un-|acquainted">unacquainted</reg> <lb/>
as we were with the general bearings of the country, <lb/>
and I reminded my companion of the hardships which we had <lb/>
<pb n="73" entity="z000000574_0100" pid="uva-lib:244552"/>
already encountered in our uncertain wanderings; in a word, I <lb/>
said that since we had deemed it advisable to enter the valley, <lb/>
we ought manfully to face the consequences, whatever they might <lb/>
be; the more especially as I was convinced there was no <reg orig="alter-|native">alternative</reg> <lb/>
left us but to fall in with the natives at once, and boldly <lb/>
risk the reception they might give us: and that as to myself, I <lb/>
felt the necessity of rest and shelter, and that until I had <reg orig="ob-|tained">obtained</reg> <lb/>
them I should be wholly unable to encounter such <reg orig="suffer-|ings">sufferings</reg> <lb/>
as we had lately passed through. To the justice of these <lb/>
observations Toby somewhat reluctantly assented.</p>
<p>We were surprised that, after moving as far as we had along <lb/>
the valley, we should still meet with the same impervious thickets; <lb/>
and thinking that although the borders of the stream might be <lb/>
lined for some distance with them, yet beyond there might be <lb/>
more open ground, I requested Toby to keep a bright look-out <lb/>
upon one side, while I did the same on the other, in order to <lb/>
discover some opening in the bushes, and especially to watch for <lb/>
the slightest appearance of a path or anything else that might <lb/>
indicate the vicinity of the islanders.</p>
<p>What furtive and anxious glances we cast into those dim-<reg orig="look-|ing">looking</reg> <lb/>
shades! With what apprehensions we proceeded, ignorant <lb/>
at what moment we might be greeted by the javelin of some <lb/>
ambushed savage! At last my companion paused, and directed <lb/>
my attention to a narrow opening in the foliage. We struck <lb/>
into it and it soon brought us by an indistinctly traced path to a <lb/>
comparatively clear space, at the further end of which we <reg orig="de-|scried">descried</reg> <lb/>
a number of the trees, the native name of which is "<reg orig="an-|nuee">annuee</reg>," <lb/>
and which bear a most delicious fruit.</p>
<p>What a race! I hobbling over the ground like some decrepid <lb/>
wretch, and Toby leaping forward like a greyhound. He <lb/>
quickly cleared one of the trees on which there were two or <lb/>
three of the fruit, but to our chagrin they proved to be much <lb/>
decayed; the rinds partly opened by the birds, and their hearts <lb/>
half devoured. However, we quickly despatched them, and no <lb/>
ambrosia could have been more delicious.</p>
<p>We looked about us uncertain whither to direct our steps, since <lb/>
the path we had so far followed appeared to be lost in the open <lb/>
space around us. At last we resolved to enter a grove near at <lb/>
hand, and had advanced a few rods when, just upon its skirts, I <lb/>
<pb n="74" entity="z000000574_0101" pid="uva-lib:244553"/>
picked up a slender bread-fruit shoot perfectly green, and with <lb/>
the tender bark freshly stript from it. It was still slippery with <lb/>
moisture, and appeared as if it had been but that moment thrown <lb/>
aside. I said nothing, but merely held it up to Toby, who <lb/>
started at this undeniable evidence of the vicinity of the savages.</p>
<p>The plot was now thickening.&mdash;A short distance further lay a <lb/>
little faggot of the same shoots bound together with a strip of <lb/>
bark. Could it have been thrown down by some solitary native <lb/>
who, alarmed at seeing us, had hurried forward to carry the tidings <lb/>
of our approach to his countrymen?&mdash;Typee or Happar?&mdash;But <lb/>
it was too late to recede, so we moved on slowly, my companion <lb/>
in advance casting eager glances under the trees on either side, <lb/>
until all at once I saw him recoil as if stung by an adder. <lb/>
Sinking on his knee, he waved me off with one hand, while with <lb/>
the other he held aside some intervening leaves and gazed <lb/>
intently at some object.</p>
<p>Disregarding his injunction, I quickly approached him and <lb/>
caught a glimpse of two figures partly hidden by the dense <lb/>
foliage; they were standing close together, and were perfectly <lb/>
motionless. They must have previously perceived us, and <reg orig="with-|drawn">withdrawn</reg> <lb/>
into the depths of the wood to elude our observation.</p>
<p>My mind was at once made up. Dropping my staff, and <lb/>
tearing open the package of things we had brought from the ship, <lb/>
I unrolled the cotton cloth, and holding it in one hand plucked <lb/>
with the other a twig from the bushes beside me, and telling <lb/>
Toby to follow my example, I broke through the covert and <lb/>
advanced, waving the branch in token of peace towards the <lb/>
shrinking forms before me.</p>
<p>They were a boy and girl, slender and graceful, and <reg orig="com-|pletely">completely</reg> <lb/>
naked, with the exception of a slight girdle of bark, from <lb/>
which depended at opposite points two of the russet leaves of <lb/>
the bread-fruit tree. An arm of the boy, half screened from <lb/>
sight by her wild tresses, was thrown about the neck of the girl, <lb/>
while with the other he held one of her hands in his; and thus <lb/>
they stood together, their heads inclined forward, catching the <lb/>
faint noise we made in our progress, and with one foot in advance, <lb/>
as if half inclined to fly from our presence.</p>
<p>As we drew near their alarm evidently increased. <reg orig="Apprehen-|sive">Apprehensive</reg> <lb/>
that they might fly from us altogether, I stopped short and <lb/>
<pb n="75" entity="z000000574_0102" pid="uva-lib:244554"/>
motioned them to advance and receive the gift I extended towards <lb/>
them, but they would not; I then uttered a few words of their <lb/>
language with which I was acquainted, scarcely expecting that <lb/>
they would understand me, but to show that we had not dropped <lb/>
from the clouds upon them. This appeared to give them a little <lb/>
confidence, so I approached nearer, presenting the cloth with <lb/>
one hand and holding the bough with the other, while they <lb/>
slowly retreated. At last they suffered us to approach so near <lb/>
to them that we were enabled to throw the cotton cloth across <lb/>
their shoulders, giving them to understand that it was theirs, and <lb/>
by a variety of gestures endeavouring to make them understand <lb/>
that we entertained the highest possible regard for them.</p>
<p>The frightened pair now stood still, whilst we endeavoured to <lb/>
make them comprehend the nature of our wants. In doing this <lb/>
Toby went through with a complete series of pantomimic <reg orig="illus-|trations&mdash;opening">illustrations&mdash;opening</reg> <lb/>
his mouth from ear to ear, and thrusting his <lb/>
fingers down his throat, gnashing his teeth and rolling his eyes <lb/>
about, till I verily believe the poor creatures took us for a couple <lb/>
of white cannibals who were about to make a meal of them. <lb/>
When, however, they understood us, they showed no inclination <lb/>
to relieve our wants. At this juncture it began to rain violently, <lb/>
and we motioned them to lead us to some place of shelter. With <lb/>
this request they appeared willing to comply, but nothing could <lb/>
evince more strongly the apprehension with which they regarded <lb/>
us, than the way in which, whilst walking before us, they kept <lb/>
their eyes constantly turned back to watch every movement we <lb/>
made, and even our very looks.</p>
<p>"Typee or Happar, Toby?" asked I as we walked after them.</p>
<p>"Of course Happar," he replied with a show of confidence <lb/>
which was intended to disguise his doubts.</p>
<p>"We shall soon know," I exclaimed; and at the same <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg> <lb/>
I stepped forward towards our guides, and pronouncing <lb/>
the two names interrogatively and pointing to the lowest part of <lb/>
the valley, endeavoured to come to the point at once. They <lb/>
repeated the words after me again and again, but without giving <lb/>
any peculiar emphasis to either, so that I was completely at a <lb/>
loss to understand them; for a couple of wilier young things <lb/>
than we afterwards found them to have been on this particular <lb/>
occasion never probably fell in any traveller's way.</p>
<pb n="76" entity="z000000574_0103" pid="uva-lib:244555"/>
<p>More and more curious to ascertain our fate, I now threw <lb/>
together in the form of a question the words "Happar" and <lb/>
"Mortarkee," the latter being equivalent to the word "good." <lb/>
The two natives interchanged glances of peculiar meaning with <lb/>
one another at this, and manifested no little surprise; but on <lb/>
the repetition of the question, after some consultation together, <lb/>
to the great joy of Toby, they answered in the affirmative. Toby <lb/>
was now in ecstasies, especially as the young savages continued <lb/>
to reiterate their answer with great energy, as though desirous <lb/>
of impressing us with the idea that being among the Happars, <lb/>
we ought to consider ourselves perfectly secure.</p>
<p>Although I had some lingering doubts, I feigned great delight <lb/>
with Toby at this announcement, while my companion broke out <lb/>
into a pantomimic abhorrence of Typee, and immeasurable love <lb/>
for the particular valley in which we were; our guides all the <lb/>
while gazing uneasily at one another as if at a loss to account <lb/>
for our conduct.</p>
<p>They hurried on, and we followed them; until suddenly they <lb/>
set up a strange halloo, which was answered from beyond the <lb/>
grove through which we were passing, and the next moment we <lb/>
entered upon some open ground, at the extremity of which we <lb/>
descried a long, low hut, and in front of it were several young <lb/>
girls. As soon as they perceived us they fled with wild screams <lb/>
into the adjoining thickets, like so many startled fawns. A few <lb/>
moments after the whole valley resounded with savage outcries, <lb/>
and the natives came running towards us from every direction.</p>
<p>Had an army of invaders made an irruption into their <reg orig="terri-|tory">territory</reg> <lb/>
they could not have evinced greater excitement. We were <lb/>
soon completely encircled by a dense throng, and in their eager <lb/>
desire to behold us they almost arrested our progress; an equal <lb/>
number surrounding our youthful guides, who with amazing <lb/>
volubility appeared to be detailing the circumstances which had <lb/>
attended their meeting with us. Every item of intelligence <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
to redouble the astonishment of the islanders, and they <lb/>
gazed at us with inquiring looks.</p>
<p>At last we reached a large and handsome building of bamboos, <lb/>
and were by signs told to enter it, the natives opening a lane for <lb/>
us through which to pass; on entering without ceremony, we <lb/>
threw our exhausted frames upon the mats that covered the floor. <lb/>
<pb n="77" entity="z000000574_0104" pid="uva-lib:244556"/>
In a moment the slight tenement was completely full of people, <lb/>
whilst those who were unable to obtain admittance gazed at us <lb/>
through its open cane-work.</p>
<p>It was now evening, and by the dim light we could just <reg orig="dis-|cern">discern</reg> <lb/>
the savage countenances around us, gleaming with wild <lb/>
curiosity and wonder; the naked forms and tattooed limbs of <lb/>
brawny warriors, with here and there the slighter figures of <lb/>
young girls, all engaged in a perfect storm of conversation, of <lb/>
which we were of course the one only theme; whilst our recent <lb/>
guides were fully occupied in answering the innumerable <reg orig="ques-|tions">questions</reg> <lb/>
which every one put to them. Nothing can exceed the <lb/>
fierce gesticulation of these people when animated in <reg orig="conver-|sation">conversation</reg>, <lb/>
and on this occasion they gave loose to all their natural <lb/>
vivacity, shouting and dancing about in a manner that well-nigh <lb/>
intimidated us.</p>
<p>Close to where we lay, squatting upon their haunches, were <lb/>
some eight or ten noble-looking chiefs&mdash;for such they subsequently <lb/>
proved to be&mdash;who, more reserved than the rest, regarded us <lb/>
with a fixed and stern attention, which not a little discomposed <lb/>
our equanimity. One of them in particular, who appeared to be <lb/>
the highest in rank, placed himself directly facing me; looking <lb/>
at me with a rigidity of aspect under which I absolutely quailed. <lb/>
He never once opened his lips, but maintained his severe <reg orig="ex-|pression">expression</reg> <lb/>
of countenance, without turning his face aside for a <lb/>
single moment. Never before had I been subjected to so strange <lb/>
and steady a glance; it revealed nothing of the mind of the <lb/>
savage, but it appeared to be reading my own.</p>
<p>After undergoing this scrutiny till I grew absolutely nervous, <lb/>
with a view of diverting it if possible, and conciliating the good <lb/>
opinion of the warrior, I took some tobacco from the bosom of <lb/>
my frock and offered it to him. He quietly rejected the proffered <lb/>
gift, and, without speaking, motioned me to return it to its <lb/>
place.</p>
<p>In my previous intercourse with the natives of Nukuheva and <lb/>
Tior, I had found that the present of a small piece of tobacco <lb/>
would have rendered any of them devoted to my service. Was <lb/>
this act of the chief a token of his enmity? Typee or Happar? <lb/>
I asked within myself. I started, for at the same moment this <lb/>
identical question was asked by the strange being before me. I <lb/>
<pb n="78" entity="z000000574_0105" pid="uva-lib:244557"/>
turned to Toby; the flickering light of a native taper showed me <lb/>
his countenance pale with trepidation at this fatal question. I <lb/>
paused for a second, and I know not by what impulse it was that <lb/>
I answered "Typee." The piece of dusky statuary nodded in <lb/>
approval, and then murmured "Mortarkee!" "Mortarkee," <lb/>
said I, without further hesitation&mdash;"Typee mortarkee."</p>
<p>What a transition! The dark figures around us leaped to <lb/>
their feet, clapped their hands in transport, and shouted again <lb/>
and again the talismanic syllables, the utterance of which <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
to have settled every thing.</p>
<p>When this commotion had a little subsided, the principal chief <lb/>
squatted once more before me, and throwing himself into a <reg orig="sud-|den">sudden</reg> <lb/>
rage, poured forth a string of philippics, which I was at no <lb/>
loss to understand, from the frequent recurrence of the word <lb/>
Happar, as being directed against the natives of the adjoining <lb/>
valley. In all these denunciations my companion and I <reg orig="ac-|quiesced">acquiesced</reg>, <lb/>
while we extolled the character of the warlike Typees. <lb/>
To be sure our panegyrics were somewhat laconic, consisting in <lb/>
the repetition of that name, united with the potent adjective <lb/>
"mortarkee." But this was sufficient, and served to conciliate <lb/>
the good will of the natives, with whom our congeniality of <reg orig="sen-|timent">sentiment</reg> <lb/>
on this point did more towards inspiring a friendly feeling <lb/>
than anything else that could have happened.</p>
<p>At last the wrath of the chief evaporated, and in a few <lb/>
moments he was as placid as ever. Laying his hand upon his <lb/>
breast, he now gave me to understand that his name was <lb/>
"Mehevi," and that, in return, he wished me to communicate <lb/>
my appellation. I hesitated for an instant, thinking that it <lb/>
might be difficult for him to pronounce my real name, and then <lb/>
with the most praiseworthy intentions intimated that I was <lb/>
known as "Tom." But I could not have made a worse selection; <lb/>
the chief could not master it: "Tommo," "Tomma," "Tommee," <lb/>
every thing but plain "Tom." As he persisted in garnishing the <lb/>
word with an additional syllable, I compromised the matter with <lb/>
him at the word "Tommo;" and by that name I went during <lb/>
the entire period of my stay in the valley. The same proceeding <lb/>
was gone through with Toby, whose mellifluous appellation was <lb/>
more easily caught.</p>
<p>An exchange of names is equivalent to a ratification of good <lb/>
<pb n="79" entity="z000000574_0106" pid="uva-lib:244558"/>
will and amity among these simple people; and as we were aware <lb/>
of this fact, we were delighted that it had taken place on the <lb/>
present occasion.</p>
<p>Reclining upon our mats, we now held a kind of levee, giving <lb/>
audience to successive troops of the natives, who introduced <lb/>
themselves to us by pronouncing their respective names, and <lb/>
retired in high good humour on receiving ours in return. <lb/>
During this ceremony the greatest merriment prevailed, nearly <lb/>
every announcement on the part of the islanders being followed <lb/>
by a fresh sally of gaiety, which induced me to believe that some <lb/>
of them at least were innocently diverting the company at our <lb/>
expense, by bestowing upon themselves a string of absurd titles, <lb/>
of the humour of which we were of course entirely ignorant.</p>
<p>All this occupied about an hour, when the throng having a <lb/>
little diminished, I turned to Mehevi and gave him to understand <lb/>
that we were in need of food and sleep. Immediately the <reg orig="atten-|tive">attentive</reg> <lb/>
chief addressed a few words to one of the crowd, who <reg orig="disap-|peared">disappeared</reg>, <lb/>
and returned in a few moments with a calabash of "<reg orig="poee-|poee">poee-poee</reg>," <lb/>
and two or three young cocoa-nuts stripped of their husks, <lb/>
and with their shells partly broken. We both of us forthwith <lb/>
placed one of these natural goblets to our lips, and drained it in <lb/>
a moment of the refreshing draught it contained. The poee-poee <lb/>
was then placed before us, and even famished as I was, I paused <lb/>
to consider in what manner to convey it to my mouth.</p>
<p>This staple article of food among the Marquese islanders is <lb/>
manufactured from the produce of the bread-fruit tree. It <reg orig="some-|what">somewhat</reg> <lb/>
resembles in its plastic nature our bookbinders' paste, is of <lb/>
a yellow colour, and somewhat tart to the taste.</p>
<p>Such was the dish, the merits of which I was now eager to <lb/>
discuss. I eyed it wistfully for a moment, and then unable any <lb/>
longer to stand on ceremony, plunged my hand into the yielding <lb/>
mass, and to the boisterous mirth of the natives drew it forth <lb/>
laden with the poee-poee, which adhered in lengthy strings to <lb/>
every finger. So stubborn was its consistency, that in conveying <lb/>
my heavily-freighted hand to my mouth, the connecting links <lb/>
almost raised the calabash from the mats on which it had been <lb/>
placed. This display of awkwardness &mdash; in which, by-the-bye, <lb/>
Toby kept me company&mdash;convulsed the bystanders with <reg orig="uncon-|trollable">uncontrollable</reg> <lb/>
laughter.</p>
<pb n="80" entity="z000000574_0107" pid="uva-lib:244559"/>
<p>As soon as their merriment had somewhat subsided, Mehevi, <lb/>
motioning us to be attentive, dipped the fore finger of his right <lb/>
hand in the dish, and giving it a rapid and scientific twirl, drew <lb/>
it out coated smoothly with the preparation. With a second <reg orig="pe-|culiar">peculiar</reg> <lb/>
flourish he prevented the poee-poee from dropping to the <lb/>
ground as he raised it to his mouth, into which the finger was <lb/>
inserted and drawn forth perfectly free from any adhesive matter. <lb/>
This performance was evidently intended for our instruction; so <lb/>
I again essayed the feat on the principles inculcated, but with <lb/>
very ill success.</p>
<p>A starving man, however, little heeds conventional proprieties, <lb/>
especially on a South-Sea Island, and accordingly Toby and I <lb/>
partook of the dish after our own clumsy fashion, beplastering <lb/>
our faces all over with the glutinous compound, and daubing our <lb/>
hands nearly to the wrist. This kind of food is by no means <lb/>
disagreeable to the palate of a European, though at first the mode <lb/>
of eating it may be. For my own part, after the lapse of a few <lb/>
days I became accustomed to its singular flavour, and grew <lb/>
remarkably fond of it.</p>
<p>So much for the first course; several other dishes followed it, <lb/>
some of which were positively delicious. We concluded our <lb/>
banquet by tossing off the contents of two more young <reg orig="cocoa-|nuts">cocoanuts</reg>, <lb/>
after which we regaled ourselves with the soothing fumes <lb/>
of tobacco, inhaled from a quaintly carved pipe which passed <lb/>
round the circle.</p>
<p>During the repast, the natives eyed us with intense curiosity, <lb/>
observing our minutest motions, and appearing to discover <lb/>
abundant matter for comment in the most trifling occurrence. <lb/>
Their surprise mounted the highest, when we began to remove <lb/>
our uncomfortable garments, which were saturated with rain. <lb/>
They scanned the whiteness of our limbs, and seemed utterly <reg orig="un-|able">unable</reg> <lb/>
to account for the contrast they presented to the swarthy <lb/>
hue of our faces, embrowned from a six months' exposure to the <lb/>
scorching sun of the Line. They felt our skin, much in the <lb/>
same way that a silk mercer would handle a remarkably fine <lb/>
piece of satin; and some of them went so far in their <reg orig="investi-|gation">investigation</reg> <lb/>
as to apply the olfactory organ.</p>
<p>Their singular behaviour almost led me to imagine that they <lb/>
never before had beheld a white man; but a few moments' <reg orig="re-|flection">reflection</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="81" entity="z000000574_0108" pid="uva-lib:244560"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">G</fw></pb>
convinced me that this could not have been the case; <lb/>
and a more satisfactory reason for their conduct has since <reg orig="sug-|gested">suggested</reg> <lb/>
itself to my mind.</p>
<p>Deterred by the frightful stories related of its inhabitants, <lb/>
ships never enter this bay, while their hostile relations with the <lb/>
tribes in the adjoining valleys prevent the Typees from visiting <lb/>
that section of the island where vessels occasionally lie. At long <lb/>
intervals, however, some intrepid captain will touch on the skirts <lb/>
of the bay, with two or three armed boats' crews, and <reg orig="accom-|panied">accompanied</reg> <lb/>
by an interpreter. The natives who live near the sea <lb/>
descry the strangers long before they reach their waters, and <lb/>
aware of the purpose for which they come, proclaim loudly the <lb/>
news of their approach. By a species of vocal telegraph the <lb/>
intelligence reaches the inmost recesses of the vale in an <reg orig="incon-|ceivably">inconceivably</reg> <lb/>
short space of time, drawing nearly its whole population <lb/>
down to the beach laden with every variety of fruit. The <reg orig="inter-|preter">interpreter</reg>, <lb/>
who is invariably a "tabooed Kannaka,"<ref target="n1" n="1">*</ref>
<note id="n1" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>The word "Kannaka" is at the present day universally used in the <lb/>
South Seas by Europeans to designate the Islanders. In the various dialects <lb/>

same sense in which the latter employ it.</p><p>A "Tabooed Kannaka" is an islander whose person has been made to a <lb/>

 leaps ashore <lb/>
with the goods intended for barter, while the boats, with their <lb/>
oars shipped, and every man on his thwart, lie just outside the <lb/>
surf, heading off from the shore, in readiness at the first untoward <lb/>
event to escape to the open sea. As soon as the traffic is <reg orig="con-|cluded">concluded</reg>, <lb/>
one of the boats pulls in under cover of the muskets of <lb/>
the others, the fruit is quickly thrown into her, and the transient <lb/>
visitors precipitately retire from what they justly consider so <lb/>
dangerous a vicinity.</p>
<p>The intercourse occurring with Europeans being so restricted, <lb/>
no wonder that the inhabitants of the valley manifested so much <lb/>
curiosity with regard to us, appearing as we did among them <lb/>
under such singular circumstances. I have no doubt that we <lb/>
were the first white men who ever penetrated thus far back into <lb/>
their territories, or at least the first who had ever descended from <lb/>
the head of the vale. What had brought us thither must have <lb/>
<pb n="82" entity="z000000574_0109" pid="uva-lib:244561"/>
appeared a complete mystery to them, and from our ignorance of <lb/>
the language it was impossible for us to enlighten them. In <lb/>
answer to inquiries which the eloquence of their gestures enabled <lb/>
us to comprehend, all that we could reply was, that we had come <lb/>
from Nukuheva, a place, be it remembered, with which they were <lb/>
at open war. This intelligence appeared to affect them with the <lb/>
most lively emotions. "Nukuheva motarkee?" they asked. Of <lb/>
course we replied most energetically in the negative.</p>
<p>They then plied us with a thousand questions, of which we <lb/>
could understand nothing more than that they had reference to <lb/>
the recent movements of the French, against whom they seemed <lb/>
to cherish the most fierce hatred. So eager were they to obtain <lb/>
information on this point, that they still continued to propound <lb/>
their queries long after we had shown that we were utterly <reg orig="un-|able">unable</reg> <lb/>
to answer them. Occasionally we caught some indistinct <lb/>
idea of their meaning, when we would endeavour by every <lb/>
method in our power to communicate the desired intelligence. <lb/>
At such times their gratification was boundless, and they would <lb/>
redouble their efforts to make us comprehend them more <reg orig="per-|fectly">perfectly</reg>. <lb/>
But all in vain; and in the end they looked at us <lb/>
despairingly, as if we were the receptacles of invaluable <reg orig="informa-|tion">information</reg>; <lb/>
but how to come at it they knew not.</p>
<p>After a while the group around us gradually dispersed, and <lb/>
we were left about midnight (as we conjectured) with those who <lb/>
appeared to be permanent residents of the house. These <reg orig="indi-|viduals">individuals</reg> <lb/>
now provided us with fresh mats to lie upon, covered us <lb/>
with several folds of tappa, and then extinguishing the tapers <lb/>
that had been burning, threw themselves down beside us, and <lb/>
after a little desultory conversation were soon sound asleep.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Various</hi> and conflicting were the thoughts which oppressed <lb/>
me during the silent hours that followed the events related in the <lb/>
preceding chapter. Toby, wearied with the fatigues of the day, <lb/>
slumbered heavily by my side; but the pain under which I was <lb/>
suffering effectually prevented my sleeping, and I remained <reg orig="dis-|tressingly">distressingly</reg> <lb/>
alive to all the fearful circumstances of our present <lb/>
situation. Was it possible that, after all our vicissitudes, we were <lb/>
really in the terrible valley of Typee, and at the mercy of its <lb/>
inmates, a fierce and unrelenting tribe of savages?</p>
<p>Typee or Happar? I shuddered when I reflected that there <lb/>
was no longer any room for doubt; and that, beyond all hope of <lb/>
escape, we were now placed in those very circumstances from <lb/>
the bare thought of which I had recoiled with such abhorrence <lb/>
but a few days before. What might not be our fearful destiny? <lb/>
To be sure, as yet we had been treated with no violence; nay, <lb/>
had been even kindly and hospitably entertained. But what <lb/>
dependence could be placed upon the fickle passions which sway <lb/>
the bosom of a savage? His inconstancy and treachery are <reg orig="pro-|verbial">proverbial</reg>. <lb/>
Might it not be that beneath these fair appearances the <lb/>
islanders covered some perfidious design, and that their friendly <lb/>
reception of us might only precede some horrible catastrophe? <lb/>
How strongly did these forebodings spring up in my mind as I <lb/>
lay restlessly upon a couch of mats, surrounded by the dimly <lb/>
revealed forms of those whom I so greatly dreaded.</p>
<p>From the excitement of these fearful thoughts I sank towards <lb/>
morning into an uneasy slumber; and on awaking, with a start, <lb/>
in the midst of an appalling dream, looked up into the eager <lb/>
countenances of a number of the natives, who were bending over <lb/>
me.</p>
<pb n="84" entity="z000000574_0111" pid="uva-lib:244563"/>
<p>It was broad day; and the house was nearly filled with young <lb/>
females, fancifully decorated with flowers, who gazed upon me <lb/>
as I rose with faces in which childish delight and curiosity were <lb/>
vividly pourtrayed. After waking Toby, they seated themselves <lb/>
round us on the mats, and gave full play to that prying <reg orig="inquisi-|tiveness">inquisitiveness</reg> <lb/>
which time out of mind has been attributed to the <lb/>
adorable sex.</p>
<p>As these unsophisticated young creatures were attended by no <lb/>
jealous duennas, their proceedings were altogether informal, and <lb/>
void of artificial restraint. Long and minute was the <reg orig="investiga-|tion">investigation</reg> <lb/>
with which they honoured us, and so uproarious their mirth, <lb/>
that I felt infinitely sheepish; and Toby was immeasurably <reg orig="out-|raged">outraged</reg> <lb/>
at their familiarity.</p>
<p>These lively young ladies were at the same time wonderfully <lb/>
polite and humane; fanning aside the insects that occasionally <lb/>
lighted on our brows; presenting us with food; and <reg orig="compassion-|ately">compassionately</reg> <lb/>
regarding me in the midst of my afflictions. But in spite <lb/>
of all their blandishments, my feelings of propriety were <reg orig="exceed-|ingly">exceedingly</reg> <lb/>
shocked, for I could not but consider them as having <reg orig="over-|stepped">overstepped</reg> <lb/>
the due limits of female decorum.</p>
<p>Having diverted themselves to their heart's content, our young <lb/>
visitants now withdrew, and gave place to successive troops of <lb/>
the other sex, who continued flocking towards the house until <lb/>
near noon; by which time I have no doubt that the greater part <lb/>
of the inhabitants of the valley had bathed themselves in the <lb/>
light of our benignant countenances.</p>
<p>At last, when their numbers began to diminish, a <reg orig="superb-|looking">superb-looking</reg> <lb/>
warrior stooped the towering plumes of his head-dress <lb/>
beneath the low portal, and entered the house. I saw at once <lb/>
that he was some distinguished personage, the natives regarding <lb/>
him with the utmost deference, and making room for him as he <lb/>
approached. His aspect was imposing. The splendid long <lb/>
drooping tail-feathers of the tropical bird, thickly interspersed <lb/>
with the gaudy plumage of the cock, were disposed in an <reg orig="im-|mense">immense</reg> <lb/>
upright semicircle upon his head, their lower extremities <lb/>
being fixed in a crescent of guinea-beads which spanned the <reg orig="fore-|head">forehead</reg>. <lb/>
Around his neck were several enormous necklaces of <lb/>
boars' tusks, polished like ivory, and disposed in such a manner <lb/>
as that the longest and largest were upon his capacious chest. <lb/>
<pb n="85" entity="z000000574_0112" pid="uva-lib:244564"/>
Thrust forward through the large apertures in his ears were two <lb/>
small and finely shaped sperm-whale teeth, presenting their <reg orig="cavi-|ties">cavities</reg> <lb/>
in front, stuffed with freshly-plucked leaves, and curiously <lb/>
wrought at the other end into strange little images and devices. <lb/>
These barbaric trinkets, garnished in this manner at their open <lb/>
extremities, and tapering and curving round to a point behind <lb/>
the ear, resembled not a little a pair of cornucopias.</p>
<p>The loins of the warrior were girt about with heavy folds of a <lb/>
dark-coloured tappa, hanging before and behind in clusters of <lb/>
braided tassels, while anklets and bracelets of curling human hair <lb/>
completed his unique costume. In his right hand he grasped a <lb/>
beautifully carved paddle-spear, nearly fifteen feet in length, <lb/>
made of the bright koar-wood, one end sharply pointed, and the <lb/>
other flattened like an oar-blade. Hanging obliquely from his <lb/>
girdle by a loop of sinnate was a richly decorated pipe, the <reg orig="slen-|der">slender</reg> <lb/>
reed forming its stem was coloured with a red pigment, and <lb/>
round it, as well as the idol-bowl, fluttered little streamers of the <lb/>
thinnest tappa.</p>
<p>But that which was most remarkable in the appearance of the <lb/>
splendid islander was the elaborated tattooing displayed on every <lb/>
noble limb. All imaginable lines and curves and figures were <lb/>
delineated over his whole body, and in their grotesque variety <lb/>
and infinite profusion I could only compare them to the crowded <lb/>
groupings of quaint patterns we sometimes see in costly pieces of <lb/>
lacework. The most simple and remarkable of all these <reg orig="orna-|ments">ornaments</reg> <lb/>
was that which decorated the countenance of the chief. <lb/>
Two broad stripes of tattooing, diverging from the centre of his <lb/>
shaven crown, obliquely crossed both eyes&mdash;staining the lids&mdash;to <lb/>
a little below either ear, where they united with another stripe <lb/>
which swept in a straight line along the lips and formed the base <lb/>
of the triangle. The warrior, from the excellence of his physical <lb/>
proportions, might certainly have been regarded as one of <reg orig="Na-|ture's">Nature's</reg> <lb/>
noblemen, and the lines drawn upon his face may possibly <lb/>
have denoted his exalted rank.</p>
<p>This warlike personage, upon entering the house, seated <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
at some distance from the spot where, Toby and myself <lb/>
reposed, while the rest of the savages looked alternately from us <lb/>
to him, as if in expectation of something they were disappointed <lb/>
in not perceiving. Regarding the chief attentively, I thought <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="z000000574_0113" pid="uva-lib:244565"/>
his lineaments appeared familiar to me. As soon as his full face <lb/>
was turned upon me, and I again beheld its extraordinary <reg orig="embel-|lishment">embellishment</reg>, <lb/>
and met the strange gaze to which I had been subjected <lb/>
the preceding night, I immediately, in spite of the alteration in <lb/>
his appearance, recognised the noble Mehevi. On addressing <lb/>
him, he advanced at once in the most cordial manner, and, <lb/>
greeting me warmly, seemed to enjoy not a little the effect his <lb/>
barbaric costume had produced upon me.</p>
<p>I forthwith determined to secure, if possible, the good will of <lb/>
this individual, as I easily perceived he was a man of great <lb/>
authority in his tribe, and one who might exert a powerful <reg orig="in-|fluence">influence</reg> <lb/>
upon our subsequent fate. In the endeavour I was not <lb/>
repulsed; for nothing could surpass the friendliness he manifested <lb/>
towards both my companion and myself. He extended his sturdy <lb/>
limbs by our side, and endeavoured to make us comprehend the <lb/>
full extent of the kindly feelings by which he was actuated. The <lb/>
almost insuperable difficulty in communicating to one another <lb/>
our ideas affected the chief with no little mortification. He evinced <lb/>
a great desire to be enlightened with regard to the customs and <lb/>
peculiarities of the far-off country we had left behind us, and to <lb/>
which under the name of Maneeka he frequently alluded.</p>
<p>But that which more than any other subject engaged his <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg> <lb/>
was the late proceedings of the "Franee," as he called the <lb/>
French, in the neighbouring bay of Nukuheva. This seemed <lb/>
a never-ending theme with him, and one concerning which he <lb/>
was never weary of interrogating us. All the information we <lb/>
succeeded in imparting to him on this subject was little more than <lb/>
that we had seen six men-of-war lying in the hostile bay at the <lb/>
time we had left it. When he received this intelligence, Mehevi, <lb/>
by the aid of his fingers, went through a long numerical <reg orig="calcula-|tion">calculation</reg>, <lb/>
as if estimating the number of Frenchmen the squadron <lb/>
might contain.</p>
<p>It was just after employing his faculties in this way that he <lb/>
happened to notice the swelling in my limb. He immediately <lb/>
examined it with the utmost attention, and after doing so <reg orig="de-|spatched">despatched</reg> <lb/>
a boy who happened to be standing by with some <lb/>
message.</p>
<p>After the lapse of a few moments the stripling re-entered the <lb/>
house with an aged islander, who might have been taken for old <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="z000000574_0114" pid="uva-lib:244566"/>
Hippocrates himself. His head was as bald as the polished <reg orig="sur-|face">surface</reg> <lb/>
of a cocoa-nut shell, which article it precisely resembled in <lb/>
smoothness and colour, while a long silvery beard swept almost <lb/>
to his girdle of bark. Encircling his temples was a bandeau of <lb/>
the twisted leaves of the Omoo tree, pressed closely over the <lb/>
brows to shield his feeble vision from the glare of the sun. His <lb/>
tottering steps were supported by a long slim staff, resembling <lb/>
the wand with which a theatrical magician appears on the stage, <lb/>
and in one hand he carried a freshly plaited fan of the green <lb/>
leaflets of the cocoa-nut tree. A flowing robe of tappa, knotted <lb/>
over the shoulder, hung loosely round his stooping form, and <lb/>
heightened the venerableness of his aspect.</p>
<p>Mehevi, saluting this old gentleman, motioned him to a seat <lb/>
between us, and then uncovering my limb, desired him to <reg orig="exa-|mine">examine</reg> <lb/>
it. The leech gazed intently from me to Toby, and then <lb/>
proceeded to business. After diligently observing the ailing <lb/>
member, he commenced manipulating it; and on the supposition <lb/>
probably that the complaint had deprived the leg of all <reg orig="sensa-|tion">sensation</reg>, <lb/>
began to pinch and hammer it in such a manner that I <lb/>
absolutely roared with the pain. Thinking that I was as capable <lb/>
of making an application of thumps and pinches to the part as <lb/>
any one else, I endeavoured to resist this species of medical <reg orig="treat-|ment">treatment</reg>. <lb/>
But it was not so easy a matter to get out of the clutches <lb/>
of the old wizard; he fastened on the unfortunate limb as if it <lb/>
were something for which he had been long seeking, and <reg orig="mutter-|ing">muttering</reg> <lb/>
some kind of incantation continued his discipline, pounding <lb/>
it after a fashion that set me well nigh crazy; while Mehevi, <lb/>
upon the same principle which prompts an affectionate mother <lb/>
to hold a struggling child in a dentist's chair, restrained me in <lb/>
his powerful grasp, and actually encouraged the wretch in this <lb/>
infliction of torture.</p>
<p>Almost frantic with rage and pain, I yelled like a bedlamite; <lb/>
while Toby, throwing himself into all the attitudes of a <reg orig="posture-|master">posture-master</reg>, <lb/>
vainly endeavoured to expostulate with the natives by <lb/>
signs and gestures. To have looked at my companion, as, <reg orig="sym-|pathising">sympathising</reg> <lb/>
with my sufferings, he strove to put an end to them, <lb/>
one would have thought that he was the deaf and dumb alphabet <lb/>
incarnated. Whether my tormentor yielded to Toby's entreaties, <lb/>
or paused from sheer exhaustion, I do not know; but all at <lb/>
<pb n="88" entity="z000000574_0115" pid="uva-lib:244567"/>
once he ceased his operations, and at the same time the chief <lb/>
relinquishing his hold upon me, I fell back, faint and breathless, <lb/>
with the agony I had endured.</p>
<p>My unfortunate limb was now left much in the same condition <lb/>
as a rump-steak after undergoing the castigating process which <lb/>
precedes cooking. My physician, having recovered from the <lb/>
fatigues of his exertions, as if anxious to make amends for the <lb/>
pain to which he had subjected me, now took some herbs out of <lb/>
a little wallet that was suspended from his waist, and moistening <lb/>
them in water, applied them to the inflamed part, stooping over <lb/>
it at the same time, and either whispering a spell, or having a <lb/>
little confidential chat with some imaginary demon located in <lb/>
the calf of my leg. My limb was now swathed in leafy bandages, <lb/>
and, grateful to Providence for the cessation of hostilities, I was <lb/>
suffered to rest.</p>
<p>Mehevi shortly after rose to depart; but before he went he spoke <lb/>
authoritatively to one of the natives whom he addressed as <reg orig="Kory-|Kory">Kory-Kory</reg>; <lb/>
and from the little I could understand of what took place, <lb/>
pointed him out to me as a man whose peculiar business <reg orig="thence-|forth">thenceforth</reg> <lb/>
would be to attend upon my person. I am not certain <lb/>
that I comprehended as much as this at the time, but the <reg orig="subse-|quent">subsequent</reg> <lb/>
conduct of my trusty body-servant fully assured me that <lb/>
such must have been the case.</p>
<p>I could not but be amused at the manner in which the chief <lb/>
addressed me upon this occasion, talking to me for at least fifteen <lb/>
or twenty minutes as calmly as if I could understand every word <lb/>
that he said. I remarked this peculiarity very often afterwards <lb/>
in many other of the islanders.</p>
<p>Mehevi having now departed, and the family physician having <lb/>
likewise made his exit, we were left about sunset with the ten or <lb/>
twelve natives, who by this time I had ascertained composed the <lb/>
household of which Toby and I were members. As the dwelling <lb/>
to which we had been first introduced was the place of my <reg orig="per-|manent">permanent</reg> <lb/>
abode while I remained in the valley, and as I was <lb/>
necessarily placed upon the most intimate footing with its <reg orig="occu-|pants">occupants</reg>, <lb/>
I may as well here enter into a little description of it and <lb/>
its inhabitants. This description will apply also to nearly all the <lb/>
other dwelling-places in the vale, and will furnish some idea of <lb/>
the generality of the natives.</p>
<pb n="89" entity="z000000574_0116" pid="uva-lib:244568"/>
<p>Near one side of the valley, and about midway up the ascent <lb/>
of a rather abrupt rise of ground waving with the richest <reg orig="ver-|dure">verdure</reg>, <lb/>
a number of large stones were laid in successive courses, to <lb/>
the height of nearly eight feet, and disposed in such a manner <lb/>
that their level surface corresponded in shape with the habitation <lb/>
which was perched upon it. A narrow space, however, was <reg orig="re-|served">reserved</reg> <lb/>
in front of the dwelling, upon the summit of this pile of <lb/>
stones, (called by the natives a "pi-pi,") which being enclosed <lb/>
by a little picket of canes, gave it somewhat the appearance of a <lb/>
verandah. The frame of the house was constructed of large <lb/>
bamboos planted uprightly, and secured together at intervals by <lb/>
transverse stalks of the light wood of the habiscus, lashed with <lb/>
thongs of bark. The rear of the tenement&mdash;built up with <reg orig="suc-|cessive">successive</reg> <lb/>
ranges of cocoa-nut boughs bound one upon another, with <lb/>
their leaflets cunningly woven together&mdash;inclined a little from <lb/>
the vertical, and extended from the extreme edge of the "pi pi" <lb/>
to about twenty feet from its surface; whence the shelving roof <lb/>
&mdash;thatched with the long tapering leaves of the palmetto&mdash;sloped <lb/>
steeply off to within about five feet of the floor; leaving the <lb/>
eaves drooping with tassel-like appendages over the front of the <lb/>
habitation. This was constructed of light and elegant canes, in <lb/>
a kind of open screen work, tastefully adorned with bindings of <lb/>
variegated sinnate, which served to hold together its various <lb/>
parts. The sides of the house were similarly built; thus <reg orig="pre-|senting">presenting</reg> <lb/>
three quarters for the circulation of the air, while the <lb/>
whole was impervious to the rain.</p>
<p>In length this picturesque building was perhaps twelve yards, <lb/>
while in breadth it could not have exceeded as many feet. So <lb/>
much for the exterior; which with its wire-like reed-twisted <lb/>
sides, not a little reminded me of an immense aviary.</p>
<p>Stooping a little, you passed through a narrow aperture in its <lb/>
front; and facing you, on entering, lay two long, perfectly straight, <lb/>
and well-polished trunks of the cocoa-nut tree, extending the full <lb/>
length of the dwelling; one of them placed closely against the <lb/>
rear, and the other lying parallel with it some two yards distant, <lb/>
the interval between them being spread with a multitude of <reg orig="gaily-|worked">gaily-worked</reg> <lb/>
mats, nearly all of a different pattern. This space <lb/>
formed the common couch and lounging place of the natives, <lb/>
answering the purpose of a divan in Oriental countries. Here <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="z000000574_0117" pid="uva-lib:244569"/>
would they slumber through the hours of the night, and recline <lb/>
luxuriously during the greater part of the day. The remainder <lb/>
of the floor presented only the cool shining surfaces of the large <lb/>
stones of which the "pi-pi" was composed.</p>
<p>From the ridge pole of the house hung suspended a number of <lb/>
large packages enveloped in coarse tappa; some of which <reg orig="con-|tained">contained</reg> <lb/>
festival dresses, and various other matters of the wardrobe, <lb/>
held in high estimation. These were easily accessible by means <lb/>
of a line, which, passing over the ridge-pole, had one end attached <lb/>
to a bundle, while with the other, which led to the side of the <lb/>
dwelling and was there secured, the package could be lowered or <lb/>
elevated at pleasure.</p>
<p>Against the farther wall of the house were arranged in tasteful <lb/>
figures a variety of spears and javelins, and other implements of <lb/>
savage warfare. Outside of the habitation, and built upon the <lb/>
piazza-like area in its front, was a little shed used as a sort of <lb/>
larder or pantry, and in which were stored various articles of <lb/>
domestic use and convenience. A few yards from the pi-pi was <lb/>
a large shed built of cocoa-nut boughs, where the process of <reg orig="pre-|paring">preparing</reg> <lb/>
the "poee-poee" was carried on, and all culinary <reg orig="opera-|tions">operations</reg> <lb/>
attended to.</p>
<p>Thus much for the house, and its appurtenances; and it will <lb/>
be readily acknowledged that a more commodious and <reg orig="appro-|priate">appropriate</reg> <lb/>
dwelling for the climate and the people could not <reg orig="pos-|sibly">possibly</reg> <lb/>
be devised. It was cool, free to admit the air, <reg orig="scrupu-|lously">scrupulously</reg> <lb/>
clean, and elevated above the dampness and impurities of <lb/>
the ground.</p>
<p>But now to sketch the inmates; and here I claim for my tried <lb/>
servitor and faithful valet Kory-Kory the precedence of a first <lb/>
description. As his character will be gradually unfolded in the <lb/>
course of my narrative, I shall for the present content myself <lb/>
with delineating his personal appearance. Kory-Kory, though <lb/>
the most devoted and best natured serving-man in the world, <lb/>
was, alas! a hideous object to look upon. He was some <lb/>
twenty-five years of age, and about six feet in height, robust and <lb/>
well made, and of the most extraordinary aspect. His head was <lb/>
carefully shaven, with the exception of two circular spots, about <lb/>
the size of a dollar, near the top of the cranium, where the hair, <lb/>
permitted to grow of an amazing length, was twisted up in two <lb/>
<pb n="91" entity="z000000574_0118" pid="uva-lib:244570"/>
prominent knots, that gave him the appearance of being <reg orig="deco-|rated">decorated</reg> <lb/>
with a pair of horns. His beard, plucked out by the roots <lb/>
from every other part of his face, was suffered to droop in hairy <lb/>
pendants, two of which garnished his upper lip, and an equal <lb/>
number hung from the extremity of his chin.</p>
<p>Kory-Kory, with a view of improving the handiwork of nature, <lb/>
and perhaps prompted by a desire to add to the engaging <reg orig="ex-|pression">expression</reg> <lb/>
of his countenance, had seen fit to embellish his face <lb/>
with three broad longitudinal stripes of tattooing, which, like <lb/>
those country roads that go straight forward in defiance of all <lb/>
obstacles, crossed his nasal organ, descended into the hollow of <lb/>
his eyes, and even skirted the borders of his mouth. Each <reg orig="com-|pletely">completely</reg> <lb/>
spanned his physiognomy; one extending in a line with <lb/>
his eyes, another crossing the face in the vicinity of the nose, <lb/>
and the third sweeping along his lips from ear to ear. His <reg orig="coun-|tenance">countenance</reg> <lb/>
thus triply hooped, as it were, with tattooing, always <lb/>
reminded me of those unhappy wretches whom I have sometimes <lb/>
observed gazing out sentimentally from behind the grated bars <lb/>
of a prison window; whilst the entire body of my savage valet, <lb/>
covered all over with representations of birds and fishes, and a <lb/>
variety of most unaccountable-looking creatures, suggested to <lb/>
me the idea of a pictorial museum of natural history, or an <lb/>
illustrated copy of `Goldsmith's Animated Nature.'</p>
<p>But it seems really heartless in me to write thus of the poor <lb/>
islander, when I owe perhaps to his unremitting attentions the <lb/>
very existence I now enjoy. Kory-Kory, I mean thee no harm <lb/>
in what I say in regard to thy outward adornings; but they were <lb/>
a little curious to my unaccustomed sight, and therefore I dilate <lb/>
upon them. But to underrate or forget thy faithful services is <lb/>
something I could never be guilty of, even in the giddiest <lb/>
moment of my life.</p>
<p>The father of my attached follower was a native of gigantic <lb/>
frame, and had once possessed prodigious physical powers; but <lb/>
the lofty form was now yielding to the inroads of time, though <lb/>
the hand of disease seemed never to have been laid upon the <lb/>
aged warrior. Marheyo&mdash;for such was his name&mdash;appeared to <lb/>
have retired from all active participation in the affairs of the <lb/>
valley, seldom or never accompanying the natives in their <lb/>
various expeditions; and employing the greater part of his time <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="z000000574_0119" pid="uva-lib:244571"/>
in throwing up a little shed just outside the house, upon which <lb/>
he was engaged to my certain knowledge for four months, <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
appearing to make any sensible advance. I suppose the old <lb/>
gentleman was in his dotage, for he manifested in various ways <lb/>
the characteristics which mark this particular stage of life.</p>
<p>I remember in particular his having a choice pair of ear-<reg orig="orna-|ments">ornaments</reg>, <lb/>
fabricated from the teeth of some sea-monster. These he <lb/>
would alternately wear and take off at least fifty times in the <lb/>
course of the day, going and coming from his little hut on each <lb/>
occasion with all the tranquillity imaginable. Sometimes slipping <lb/>
them through the slits in his ears, he would seize his spear&mdash; <lb/>
which in length and slightness resembled a fishing-pole&mdash;and go <lb/>
stalking beneath the shadows of the neighbouring groves, as if <lb/>
about to give a hostile meeting to some cannibal knight. But <lb/>
he would soon return again, and hiding his weapon under the <lb/>
projecting eaves of the house, and rolling his clumsy trinkets <lb/>
carefully in a piece of tappa, would resume his more pacific <lb/>
operations as quietly as if he had never interrupted them.</p>
<p>But despite his eccentricities, Marheyo was a most paternal <lb/>
and warm-hearted old fellow, and in this particular not a little <lb/>
resembled his son Kory-Kory. The mother of the latter was <lb/>
the mistress of the family, and a notable housewife, and a most <lb/>
industrious old lady she was. If she did not understand the art <lb/>
of making jellies, jams, custards, tea-cakes, and such like trashy <lb/>
affairs, she was profoundly skilled in the mysteries of preparing <lb/>
"amar," "poee-poee," and "kokoo," with other substantial <lb/>
matters. She was a genuine busy-body; bustling about the <lb/>
house like a country landlady at an unexpected arrival; for ever <lb/>
giving the young girls tasks to perform, which the little hussies <lb/>
as often neglected; poking into every corner, and rummaging <lb/>
over bundles of old tappa, or making a prodigious clatter among <lb/>
the calabashes. Sometimes she might have been seen squatting <lb/>
upon her haunches in front of a huge wooden basin, and <reg orig="knead-|ing">kneading</reg> <lb/>
poee-poee with terrific vehemence, dashing the stone pestle <lb/>
about as if she would shiver the vessel into fragments; on other <lb/>
occasions, galloping about the valley in search of a particular <lb/>
kind of leaf, used in some of her recondite operations, and <reg orig="re-|turning">returning</reg> <lb/>
home, toiling and sweating, with a bundle of it, under <lb/>
which most women would have sunk.</p>
<pb n="93" entity="z000000574_0120" pid="uva-lib:244572"/>
<p>To tell the truth, Kory-Kory's mother was the only industrious <lb/>
person in all the valley of Typee; and she could not have <reg orig="em-|ployed">employed</reg> <lb/>
herself more actively had she been left an exceedingly <lb/>
muscular and destitute widow, with an inordinate supply of <lb/>
young children, in the bleakest part of the civilized world. <lb/>
There was not the slightest necessity for the greater portion of <lb/>
the labour performed by the old lady: but she seemed to work <lb/>
from some irresistible impulse; her limbs continually swaying to <lb/>
and fro, as if there were some indefatigable engine concealed <lb/>
within her body which kept her in perpetual motion.</p>
<p>Never suppose that she was a termagant or a shrew for all <lb/>
this; she had the kindliest heart in the world, and acted towards <lb/>
me in particular in a truly maternal manner, occasionally putting <lb/>
some little morsel of choice food into my hand, some outlandish <lb/>
kind of savage sweetmeat or pastry, like a doting mother petting <lb/>
a sickly urchin with tarts and sugar-plums. Warm indeed are <lb/>
my remembrances of the dear, good, affectionate old Tinor!</p>
<p>Besides the individuals I have mentioned, there belonged to <lb/>
the household three young men, dissipated, good-for-nothing, <lb/>
roystering blades of savages, who were either employed in <reg orig="pro-|secuting">prosecuting</reg> <lb/>
love-affairs with the maidens of the tribe, or grew boozy <lb/>
on "arva" and tobacco in the company of congenial spirits, the <lb/>
scapegraces of the valley.</p>
<p>Among the permanent inmates of the house were likewise <lb/>
several lovely damsels, who instead of thrumming pianos and <lb/>
reading novels, like more enlightened young ladies, substituted <lb/>
for these employments the manufacture of a fine species of tappa; <lb/>
but for the greater portion of the time were skipping from house <lb/>
to house, gadding and gossiping with their acquaintances.</p>
<p>From the rest of these, however, I must except the beauteous <lb/>
nymph Fayaway, who was my peculiar favourite. Her free pliant <lb/>
figure was the very perfection of female grace and beauty. Her <lb/>
complexion was a rich and mantling olive, and when watching <lb/>
the glow upon her cheeks I could almost swear that beneath the <lb/>
transparent medium there lurked the blushes of a faint vermilion. <lb/>
The face of this girl was a rounded oval, and each feature as <lb/>
perfectly formed as the heart or imagination of man could desire. <lb/>
Her full lips, when parted with a smile, disclosed teeth of a <reg orig="daz-|zling">dazzling</reg> <lb/>
whiteness; and when her rosy mouth opened with a burst <lb/>
<pb n="94" entity="z000000574_0121" pid="uva-lib:244573"/>
of merriment, they looked like the milk-white seeds of the <lb/>
"arta," a fruit of the valley, which, when cleft in twain, shows <lb/>
them reposing in rows on either side, imbedded in the rich and <lb/>
juicy pulp. Her hair of the deepest brown, parted irregularly <lb/>
in the middle, flowed in natural ringlets over her shoulders, and <lb/>
whenever she chanced to stoop, fell over and hid from view her <lb/>
lovely bosom. Gazing into the depths of her strange blue eyes, <lb/>
when she was in a contemplative mood, they seemed most placid <lb/>
yet unfathomable; but when illuminated by some lively emotion, <lb/>
they beamed upon the beholder like stars. The hands of <reg orig="Fay-|away">Fayaway</reg> <lb/>
were as soft and delicate as those of any countess; for an <lb/>
entire exemption from rude labour marks the girlhood and even <lb/>
prime of a Typee woman's life. Her feet, though wholly exposed, <lb/>
were as diminutive and fairly shaped as those which peep from <lb/>
beneath the skirts of a Lima lady's dress. The skin of this young <lb/>
creature, from continual ablutions and the use of mollifying <lb/>
ointments, was inconceivably smooth and soft.</p>
<p>I may succeed, perhaps, in particularising some of the <reg orig="indi-|vidual">individual</reg> <lb/>
features of Fayaway's beauty, but that general loveliness of <lb/>
appearance which they all contributed to produce I will not <lb/>
attempt to describe. The easy unstudied graces of a child of <lb/>
nature like this, breathing from infancy an atmosphere of <reg orig="per-|petual">perpetual</reg> <lb/>
summer, and nurtured by the simple fruits of the earth; <lb/>
enjoying a perfect freedom from care and anxiety, and removed <lb/>
effectually from all injurious tendencies, strike the eye in a <lb/>
manner which cannot be pourtrayed. This picture is no fancy <lb/>
sketch; it is drawn from the most vivid recollections of the person <lb/>
delineated.</p>
<p>Were I asked if the beauteous form of Fayaway was altogether <lb/>
free from the hideous blemish of tattooing, I should be constraind <lb/>
to answer that it was not. But the practitioners of the barbarous <lb/>
art, so remorseless in their inflictions upon the brawny limbs of <lb/>
the warriors of the tribe, seem to be conscious that it needs not <lb/>
the resources of their profession to augment the charms of the <lb/>
maidens of the vale.</p>
<p>The females are very little embellished in this way, and <lb/>
Fayaway, with all the other young girls of her age, were even <lb/>
less so than those of their sex more advanced in years. The <lb/>
reason of this peculiarity will be alluded to hereafter. All the <lb/>
<pb n="95" entity="z000000574_0122" pid="uva-lib:244574"/>
tattooing that the nymph in question exhibited upon her person <lb/>
may be easily described. Three minute dots, no bigger than <reg orig="pin-|heads">pinheads</reg>, <lb/>
decorated either lip, and at a little distance were not at all <lb/>
discernible. Just upon the fall of the shoulder were drawn two <lb/>
parallel lines half an inch apart, and perhaps three inches in <lb/>
length, the interval being filled with delicately executed figures. <lb/>
These narrow bands of tattooing, thus placed, always reminded <lb/>
me of those stripes of gold lace worn by officers in undress, and <lb/>
which were in lieu of epaulettes to denote their rank.</p>
<p>Thus much was Fayaway tattooed&mdash;the audacious hand which <lb/>
had gone so far in its desecrating work stopping short, <reg orig="appa-|rently">apparently</reg> <lb/>
wanting the heart to proceed.</p>
<p>But I have omitted to describe the dress worn by this nymph <lb/>
of the valley.</p>
<p>Fayaway&mdash;I must avow the fact&mdash;for the most part clung to <lb/>
the primitive and summer garb of Eden. But how becoming <lb/>
the costume! It showed her fine figure to the best possible <reg orig="ad-|vantage">advantage</reg>; <lb/>
and nothing could have been better adapted to her <lb/>
peculiar style of beauty. On ordinary occasions she was habited <lb/>
precisely as I have described the two youthful savages whom we <lb/>
had met on first entering the valley. At other times, when <reg orig="ram-|bling">rambling</reg> <lb/>
among the groves, or visiting at the houses of her <reg orig="ac-|quaintances">acquaintances</reg>, <lb/>
she wore a tunic of white tappa, reaching from her <lb/>
waist to a little below the knees; and when exposed for any <lb/>
length of time to the sun, she invariably protected herself from <lb/>
its rays by a floating mantle of the same material, loosely <lb/>
gathered about the person. Her gala dress will be described <lb/>
hereafter.</p>
<p>As the beauties of our own land delight in bedecking <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
with fanciful articles of jewellery, suspending them from <lb/>
their ears, hanging them about their necks, and clasping them <lb/>
around their wrists; so Fayaway and her companions were in <lb/>
the habit of ornamenting themselves with similar appendages.</p>
<p>Flora was their jeweller. Sometimes they wore necklaces of <lb/>
small carnation flowers, strung like rubies upon a fibre of tappa, <lb/>
or displayed in their ears a single white bud, the stem thrust <lb/>
backward through the aperture, and showing in front the delicate <lb/>
petals folded together in a beautiful sphere, and looking like a <lb/>
drop of the purest pearl. Chaplets too, resembling in their <reg orig="ar-|rangement">arrangement</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="96" entity="z000000574_0123" pid="uva-lib:244575"/>
the strawberry coronal worn by an English peeress, <lb/>
and composed of intertwined leaves and blossoms, often crowned <lb/>
their temples; and bracelets and anklets of the same tasteful <lb/>
pattern were frequently to be seen. Indeed, the maidens of the <lb/>
island were passionately fond of flowers, and never wearied of <lb/>
decorating their persons with them; a lovely trait in their <reg orig="cha-|racter">character</reg>, <lb/>
and one that ere long will be more fully alluded to.</p>
<p>Though in my eyes, at least, Fayaway was indisputably the <lb/>
loveliest female I saw in Typee, yet the description I have given <lb/>
of her will in some measure apply to nearly all the youthful <reg orig="por-|tion">portion</reg> <lb/>
of her sex in the valley. Judge ye then, reader, what <lb/>
beautiful creatures they must have been.</p>

</argument>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">When</hi> Mehevi had departed from the house, as related in the <lb/>
preceding chapter, Kory-Kory commenced the functions of the <lb/>
post assigned him. He brought us various kinds of food; and, <lb/>
as if I were an infant, insisted upon feeding me with his own <lb/>
hands. To this procedure I, of course, most earnestly objected, <lb/>
but in vain; and having laid a calabash of kokoo before me, he <lb/>
washed his fingers in a vessel of water, and then putting his <lb/>
hand into the dish and rolling the food into little balls, put them <lb/>
one after another into my mouth. All my remonstrances against <lb/>
this measure only provoked so great a clamour on his part, that <lb/>
I was obliged to acquiesce; and the operation of feeding being <lb/>
thus facilitated, the meal was quickly despatched. As for Toby, <lb/>
he was allowed to help himself after his own fashion.</p>
<p>The repast over, my attendant arranged the mats for repose, <lb/>
and, bidding me lie down, covered me with a large robe of <lb/>
tappa, at the same time looking approvingly upon me, and <reg orig="ex-|claiming">exclaiming</reg>, <lb/>
"Ki-Ki, muee muee, ah! moee moee mortarkee" (eat <lb/>
plenty, ah! sleep very good). The philosophy of this sentiment <lb/>
I did not pretend to question; for deprived of sleep for several <lb/>
preceding nights, and the pain in my limb having much abated, <lb/>
I now felt inclined to avail myself of the opportunity afforded me.</p>
<p>The next morning, on waking, I found Kory-Kory stretched <lb/>
out on one side of me, while my companion lay upon the other. <lb/>
I felt sensibly refreshed after a night of sound repose, and <reg orig="imme-|diately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
agreed to the proposition of my valet that I should repair <lb/>
to the water and wash, although dreading the suffering that the <lb/>
exertion might produce. From this apprehension, however, I <lb/>
<pb n="98" entity="z000000574_0125" pid="uva-lib:244577"/>
was quickly relieved; for Kory-Kory, leaping from the pi-pi, <lb/>
and then backing himself up against it, like a porter in readiness <lb/>
to shoulder a trunk, with loud vociferations and a <reg orig="superabund-|ance">superabundance</reg> <lb/>
of gestures, gave me to understand that I was to mount <lb/>
upon his back and be thus transported to the stream, which <lb/>
flowed perhaps two hundred yards from the house.</p>
<p>Our appearance upon the verandah in front of the habitation <lb/>
drew together quite a crowd, who stood looking on and <reg orig="convers-|ing">conversing</reg> <lb/>
with one another in the most animated manner. They <reg orig="re-|minded">reminded</reg> <lb/>
one of a group of idlers gathered about the door of a <lb/>
village tavern when the equipage of some distinguished traveller <lb/>
is brought round previous to his departure. As soon as I clasped <lb/>
my arms about the neck of the devoted fellow, and he jogged off <lb/>
with me, the crowd&mdash;composed chiefly of young girls and boys&mdash; <lb/>
followed after, shouting and capering with infinite glee, and <lb/>
accompanied us to the banks of the stream.</p>
<p>On gaining it, Kory-Kory, wading up to his hips in the water, <lb/>
carried me half way across, and deposited me on a smooth black <lb/>
stone which rose a few inches above the surface. The <reg orig="amphi-|bious">amphibious</reg> <lb/>
rabble at our heels plunged in after us, and, climbing to <lb/>
the summit of the grass-grown rocks with which the bed of the <lb/>
brook was here and there broken, waited curiously to witness <lb/>
our morning ablutions.</p>
<p>Somewhat embarrassed by the presence of the female portion <lb/>
of the company, and feeling my cheeks burning with bashful <lb/>
timidity, I formed a primitive basin by joining my hands <reg orig="toge-|ther">together</reg>, <lb/>
and cooled my blushes in the water it contained; then <lb/>
removing my frock, bent over and washed myself down to my <lb/>
waist in the stream. As soon as Kory-Kory comprehended from <lb/>
my motions that this was to be the extent of my performance, <lb/>
he appeared perfectly aghast with astonishment, and rushing <lb/>
towards me, poured out a torrent of words in eager deprecation <lb/>
of so limited an operation, enjoining me by unmistakeable signs <lb/>
to immerse my whole body. To this I was forced to consent; <lb/>
and the honest fellow regarding me as a froward, inexperienced <lb/>
child, whom it was his duty to serve at the risk of offending, <lb/>
lifted me from the rock, and tenderly bathed my limbs. This <lb/>
over, and resuming my seat, I could not avoid bursting into <lb/>
admiration of the scene around me.</p>
<pb n="99" entity="z000000574_0126" pid="uva-lib:244578"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">H 2</fw></pb>
<p>From the verdant surfaces of the large stones that lay scattered <lb/>
about, the natives were now sliding off into the water, diving and <lb/>
ducking beneath the surface in all directions&mdash;the young girls <lb/>
springing buoyantly into the air, and revealing their naked forms <lb/>
to the waist, with their long tresses dancing about their shoulders, <lb/>
their eyes sparkling like drops of dew in the sun, and their gay <lb/>
laughter pealing forth at every frolicsome incident.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the day that I took my first bath in the <lb/>
valley, we received another visit from Mehevi. The noble savage <lb/>
seemed to be in the same pleasant mood, and was quite as cordial <lb/>
in his manner as before. After remaining about an hour, he rose <lb/>
from the mats, and motioning to leave the house, invited Toby <lb/>
and myself to accompany him. I pointed to my leg; but <reg orig="Me-|hevi">Mehevi</reg> <lb/>
in his turn pointed to Kory-Kory, and removed that <reg orig="objec-|tion">objection</reg>; <lb/>
so, mounting upon the faithful fellow's shoulders again&mdash; <lb/>
like the old man of the sea astride of Sindbad&mdash;I followed after <lb/>
the chief.</p>
<p>The nature of the route we now pursued struck me more <lb/>
forcibly than anything I had yet seen, as illustrating the indolent <lb/>
disposition of the islanders. The path was obviously the most <lb/>
beaten one in the valley, several others leading from either side <lb/>
into it, and perhaps for successive generations it had formed the <lb/>
principal avenue of the place. And yet, until I grew more <reg orig="fami-|liar">familiar</reg> <lb/>
with its impediments, it seemed as difficult to travel as the <lb/>
recesses of a wilderness. Part of it swept round an abrupt rise <lb/>
of ground, the surface of which was broken by frequent <reg orig="inequa-|lities">inequalities</reg>, <lb/>
and thickly strewn with projecting masses of rocks, whose <lb/>
summits were often hidden from view by the drooping foliage of the <lb/>
luxuriant vegetation. Sometimes directly over, sometimes <reg orig="evad-|ing">evading</reg> <lb/>
these obstacles with a wide circuit, the path wound along;&mdash; <lb/>
one moment climbing over a sudden eminence smooth with <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
wear, then descending on the other side into a steep glen, <lb/>
and crossing the flinty channel of a brook. Here it pursued the <lb/>
depths of a glade, occasionally obliging you to stoop beneath vast <lb/>
horizontal branches; and now you stepped over huge trunks and <lb/>
boughs that lay rotting across the track.</p>
<p>Such was the grand thoroughfare of Typee. After proceeding <lb/>
a little distance along it&mdash;Kory-Kory panting and blowing with <lb/>
the weight of his burden&mdash;I dismounted from his back, and <lb/>
<pb n="100" entity="z000000574_0127" pid="uva-lib:244579"/>
grasping the long spear of Mehevi in my hand, assisted my steps <lb/>
over the numerous obstacles of the road; preferring this mode of <lb/>
advance to one which, from the difficulties of the way, was equally <lb/>
painful to myself and my wearied servitor.</p>
<p>Our journey was soon at an end; for, scaling a sudden height, <lb/>
we came abruptly upon the place of our destination. I wish that it <lb/>
were possible to sketch in words this spot as vividly as I <reg orig="recol-|lect">recollect</reg> <lb/>
it.</p>
<p>Here were situated the Taboo groves of the valley&mdash;the scene <lb/>
of many a prolonged feast, of many a horrid rite. Beneath the <lb/>
dark shadows of the consecrated bread-fruit trees there reigned a <lb/>
solemn twilight&mdash;a cathedral-like gloom. The frightful genius <lb/>
of pagan worship seemed to brood in silence over the place, <lb/>
breathing its spell upon every object around. Here and there, <lb/>
in the depths of these awful shades, half screened from sight by <lb/>
masses of overhanging foliage, rose the idolatrous altars of the <lb/>
savages, built of enormous blocks of black and polished stone, <lb/>
placed one upon another, without cement, to the height of twelve <lb/>
or fifteen feet, and surmounted by a rustic open temple, enclosed <lb/>
with a low picket of canes, within which might be seen, in various <lb/>
stages of decay, offerings of bread-fruit and cocoa-nuts, and the <lb/>
putrefying relics of some recent sacrifice.</p>
<p>In the midst of the wood was the hallowed "hoolah hoolah" <lb/>
ground&mdash;set apart for the celebration of the fantastic religious <lb/>
ritual of these people&mdash;comprising an extensive oblong pi-pi, <lb/>
terminating at either end in a lofty terraced altar, guarded by <lb/>
ranks of hideous wooden idols, and with the two remaining sides <lb/>
flanked by ranges of bamboo sheds, opening towards the interior <lb/>
of the quadrangle thus formed. Vast trees, standing in the middle <lb/>
of this space, and throwing over it an umbrageous shade, had <lb/>
their massive trunks built round with slight stages, elevated a <lb/>
few feet above the ground, and railed in with canes, forming so <lb/>
many rustic pulpits, from which the priests harangued their <lb/>
devotees.</p>
<p>This holiest of spots was defended from profanation by the <lb/>
strictest edicts of the all-pervading "taboo," which condemned <lb/>
to instant death the sacrilegious female who should enter or touch <lb/>
its sacred precincts, or even so much as press with her feet the <lb/>
ground made holy by the shadows that it cast.</p>
<pb n="101" entity="z000000574_0128" pid="uva-lib:244580"/>
<p>Access was had to the enclosure through an embowered <reg orig="en-|trance">entrance</reg> <lb/>
on one side, facing a number of towering cocoa-nut trees, <lb/>
planted at intervals along a level area of a hundred yards. At the <lb/>
further extremity of this space was to be seen a building of <reg orig="con-|siderable">considerable</reg> <lb/>
size, reserved for the habitation of the priests and <reg orig="re-|ligious">religious</reg> <lb/>
attendants of the groves.</p>
<p>In its vicinity was another remarkable edifice, built as usual <lb/>
upon the summit of a pi-pi, and at least two hundred feet in <lb/>
length, though not more than twenty in breadth. The whole <lb/>
front of this latter structure was completely open, and from one <lb/>
end to the other ran a narrow verandah, fenced in on the edge of <lb/>
the pi-pi with a picket of canes. Its interior presented the <reg orig="ap-|pearance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
of an immense lounging-place, the entire floor being <lb/>
strewn with successive layers of mats, lying between parallel <lb/>
trunks of cocoa-nut trees, selected for the purpose from the <lb/>
straightest and most symmetrical the vale afforded.</p>
<p>To this building, denominated in the language of the natives <lb/>
the "Ti," Mehevi now conducted us. Thus far we had been <lb/>
accompanied by a troop of the natives of both sexes; but as soon <lb/>
as we approached its vicinity, the females gradually separated <lb/>
themselves from the crowd, and standing aloof, permitted us to <lb/>
pass on. The merciless prohibitions of the taboo extended likewise <lb/>
to this edifice, and were enforced by the same dreadful penalty <lb/>
that secured the Hoolah Hoolah ground from the imaginary <reg orig="pol-|lution">pollution</reg> <lb/>
of a woman's presence.</p>
<p>On entering the house, I was surprised to see six muskets <lb/>
ranged against the bamboo on one side, from the barrels of which <lb/>
depended as many small canvas pouches, partly filled with powder. <lb/>
Disposed about these muskets, like the cutlasses that decorate <lb/>
the bulkhead of a man-of-war's cabin, were a great variety of <lb/>
rude spears and paddles, javelins, and war-clubs. This then, said <lb/>
I to Toby, must be the armory of the tribe.</p>
<p>As we advanced further along the building, we were struck <lb/>
with the aspect of four or five hideous old wretches, on whose <lb/>
decrepit forms time and tattooing seemed to have obliterated <lb/>
every trace of humanity. Owing to the continued operation of <lb/>
this latter process, which only terminates among the warriors of <lb/>
the island after all the figures stretched upon their limbs in <lb/>
youth have been blended together&mdash;an effect, however, produced <lb/>
<pb n="102" entity="z000000574_0129" pid="uva-lib:244581"/>
only in cases of extreme longevity &mdash; the bodies of these men <lb/>
were of a uniform dull green colour&mdash;the hue which the tattooing <lb/>
gradually assumes as the individual advances in age. Their skin <lb/>
had a frightful scaly appearance, which, united with its singular <lb/>
colour, made their limbs not a little resemble dusty specimens of <lb/>
verde-antique. Their flesh, in parts, hung upon them in huge <lb/>
folds, like the overlapping plaits on the flank of a rhinoceros. <lb/>
Their heads were completely bald, whilst their faces were <lb/>
puckered into a thousand wrinkles, and they presented no <reg orig="ves-|tige">vestige</reg> <lb/>
of a beard. But the most remarkable peculiarity about <lb/>
them was the appearance of their feet; the toes, like the <reg orig="ra-|diating">radiating</reg> <lb/>
lines of the mariner's compass, pointed to every quarter <lb/>
of the horizon. This was doubtless attributable to the fact, <lb/>
that during nearly a hundred years of existence the said toes <lb/>
never had been subjected to any artificial confinement, and in <lb/>
their old age, being averse to close neighbourhood, bid one <reg orig="an-|other">another</reg> <lb/>
keep open order.</p>
<p>These repulsive-looking creatures appeared to have lost the <lb/>
use of their lower limbs altogether; sitting upon the floor <reg orig="cross-|legged">crosslegged</reg> <lb/>
in a state of torpor. They never heeded us in the least, <lb/>
scarcely looking conscious of our presence, while Mehevi seated <lb/>
us upon the mats, and Kory-Kory gave utterance to some <reg orig="unin-|telligible">unintelligible</reg> <lb/>
gibberish.</p>
<p>In a few moments a boy entered with a wooden trencher of <lb/>
poee-poee; and in regaling myself with its contents I was obliged <lb/>
again to submit to the officious intervention of my indefatigable <lb/>
servitor. Various other dishes followed, the chief manifesting <lb/>
the most hospitable importunity in pressing us to partake, and to <lb/>
remove all bashfulness on our part, set us no despicable example <lb/>
in his own person.</p>
<p>The repast concluded, a pipe was lighted, which passed from <lb/>
mouth to mouth, and yielding to its soporific influence, the quiet <lb/>
of the place, and the deepening shadows of approaching night, <lb/>
my companion and I sank into a kind of drowsy repose, while <lb/>
the chief and Kory-Kory seemed to be slumbering beside us.</p>
<p>I awoke from an uneasy nap, about midnight, as I supposed; <lb/>
and, raising myself partly from the mat, became sensible that we <lb/>
were enveloped in utter darkness. Toby lay still asleep, but our <lb/>
late companions had disappeared. The only sound that <reg orig="inter-|rupted">interrupted</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="103" entity="z000000574_0130" pid="uva-lib:244582"/>
the silence of the place was the asthmatic breathing of the <lb/>
old men I have mentioned, who reposed at a little distance from <lb/>
us. Beside them, as well as I could judge, there was no one else <lb/>
in the house.</p>
<p>Apprehensive of some evil, I roused my comrade, and we <lb/>
were engaged in a whispered conference concerning the <reg orig="unex-|pected">unexpected</reg> <lb/>
withdrawal of the natives, when all at once, from the <lb/>
depths of the grove, in full view of us where we lay, shoots of <lb/>
flame were seen to rise, and in a few moments illuminated the <lb/>
surrounding trees, casting, by contrast, into still deeper gloom <lb/>
the darkness around us.</p>
<p>While we continued gazing at this sight, dark figures appeared <lb/>
moving to and fro before the flames; while others, dancing and <lb/>
capering about, looked like so many demons.</p>
<p>Regarding this new phenomenon with no small degree of <reg orig="tre-|pidation">trepidation</reg>, <lb/>
I said to my companion, "What can all this mean, <lb/>
Toby?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing," replied he; "getting the fire ready, I <reg orig="sup-|pose">suppose</reg>."</p>
<p>"Fire!" exclaimed I, while my heart took to beating like a <lb/>
trip-hammer, "what fire?"</p>
<p>"Why, the fire to cook us, to be sure; what else would the <lb/>
cannibals be kicking up such a row about if it were not for <lb/>
that?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Toby! have done with your jokes; this is no time for <lb/>
them; something is about to happen, I feel confident."</p>
<p>"Jokes, indeed!" exclaimed Toby, indignantly. "Did you <lb/>
ever hear me joke? Why, for what do you suppose the devils <lb/>
have been feeding us up in this kind of style during the last <lb/>
three days, unless it were for something that you are too much <lb/>
frightened at to talk about? Look at that Kory-Kory there!&mdash; <lb/>
has he not been stuffing you with his confounded mushes, just in <lb/>
the way they treat swine before they kill them? Depend upon <lb/>
it, we will be eaten this blessed night, and there is the fire we <lb/>
shall be roasted by."</p>
<p>This view of the matter was not at all calculated to allay my <lb/>
apprehensions, and I shuddered when I reflected that we were <lb/>
indeed at the mercy of a tribe of cannibals, and that the dreadful <lb/>
<pb n="104" entity="z000000574_0131" pid="uva-lib:244583"/>
contingency to which Toby had alluded was by no means removed <lb/>
beyond the bounds of possibility.</p>
<p>"There! I told you so! they are coming for us!" exclaimed <lb/>
my companion the next moment, as the forms of four of the <lb/>
islanders were seen in bold relief against the illuminated <reg orig="back-|ground">background</reg>, <lb/>
mounting the pi-pi and approaching towards us.</p>
<p>They came on noiselessly, nay stealthily, and glided along <lb/>
through the gloom that surrounded us as if about to spring upon <lb/>
some object they were fearful of disturbing before they should <lb/>
make sure of it.&mdash;Gracious heaven! the horrible reflections <lb/>
which crowded upon me that moment.&mdash;A cold sweat stood upon <lb/>
my brow, and spell-bound with terror I awaited my fate!</p>
<p>Suddenly the silence was broken by the well-remembered tones <lb/>
of Mehevi, and at the kindly accents of his voice my fears were <lb/>
immediately dissipated. "Tommo, Toby, ki ki!" (eat).&mdash;He <lb/>
had waited to address us until he had assured himself that we <lb/>
were both awake, at which he seemed somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>"Ki ki! is it?" said Toby in his gruff tones; "well, cook us <lb/>
first, will you?&mdash;but what's this?" he added, as another savage <lb/>
appeared, bearing before him a large trencher of wood, <reg orig="contain-|ing">containing</reg> <lb/>
some kind of steaming meat, as appeared from the odours it <lb/>
diffused, and which he deposited at the feet of Mehevi. "A <lb/>
baked baby, I dare say! but I will have none of it, never mind <lb/>
what it is.&mdash;A pretty fool I should make of myself, indeed, waked <lb/>
up here in the middle of the night, stuffing and guzzling, and all <lb/>
to make a fat meal for a parcel of bloody-minded cannibals one <lb/>
of these mornings!&mdash;No, I see what they are at very plainly, so <lb/>
I am resolved to starve myself into a bunch of bones and gristle, <lb/>
and then, if they serve me up, they are welcome! But I say, <lb/>
Tommo, you are not going to eat any of that mess there, in the <lb/>
dark, are you? Why, how can you tell what it is?"</p>
<p>"By tasting it, to be sure," said I, masticating a morsel that <lb/>
Kory-Kory had just put in my mouth; "and excellently good it <lb/>
is too, very much like veal."</p>
<p>"A baked baby, by the soul of Captain Cook!" burst forth <lb/>
Toby, with amazing vehemence; "Veal! why there never was <lb/>
a calf on the island till you landed. I tell you you are bolting <lb/>
down mouthfuls from a dead Happar's carcass, as sure as you <lb/>
live, and no mistake!"</p>
<pb n="105" entity="z000000574_0132" pid="uva-lib:244584"/>
<p>Emetics and lukewarm water! What a sensation in the <reg orig="abdo-|minal">abdominal</reg> <lb/>
regions! Sure enough, where could the fiends incarnate <lb/>
have obtained meat? But I resolved to satisfy myself at all <lb/>
hazards; and turning to Mehevi, I soon made the ready chief <lb/>
understand that I wished a light to be brought. When the taper <lb/>
came, I gazed eagerly into the vessel, and recognised the <reg orig="muti-|lated">mutilated</reg> <lb/>
remains of a juvenile porker! "Puarkee!" exclaimed <lb/>
Kory-Kory, looking complacently at the dish; and from that <lb/>
day to this I have never forgotten that such is the designation of <lb/>
a pig in the Typee lingo.</p>
<p>The next morning, after being again abundantly feasted by <lb/>
the hospitable Mehevi, Toby and myself arose to depart. But <lb/>
the chief requested us to postpone our intention. "Abo, abo," <lb/>
(Wait, wait,) he said, and accordingly we resumed our seats, <lb/>
while, assisted by the zealous Kory-Kory, he appeared to be <reg orig="en-|gaged">engaged</reg> <lb/>
in giving directions to a number of the natives outside, <lb/>
who were busily employed in making arrangements, the nature <lb/>
of which we could not comprehend. But we were not left long <lb/>
in our ignorance, for a few moments only had elapsed when the <lb/>
chief beckoned us to approach, and we perceived that he had <lb/>
been marshalling a kind of guard of honour to escort us on our <lb/>
return to the house of Marheyo.</p>
<p>The procession was led off by two venerable-looking savages, <lb/>
each provided with a spear, from the end of which streamed a <lb/>
pennon of milk-white tappa. After them went several youths, <lb/>
bearing aloft calabashes of poee-poee; and followed in their turn <lb/>
by four stalwart fellows, sustaining long bamboos, from the tops <lb/>
of which hung suspended, at least twenty feet from the ground, <lb/>
large baskets of green bread-fruit. Then came a troop of boys, <lb/>
carrying bunches of ripe banannas, and baskets made of the <lb/>
woven leaflets of cocoa-nut boughs, filled with the young fruit of <lb/>
the tree, the naked shells stripped of their husks peeping forth <lb/>
from the verdant wicker-work that surrounded them. Last of all <lb/>
came a burly islander, holding over his head a wooden trencher, <lb/>
in which lay disposed the remnants of our midnight feast, hidden <lb/>
from view, however, by a covering of bread-fruit leaves.</p>
<p>Astonished as I was at this exhibition, I could not avoid <lb/>
smiling at its grotesque appearance, and the associations it <reg orig="natu-|rally">naturally</reg> <lb/>
called up. Mehevi, it seemed, was bent on replenishing <lb/>
<pb n="106" entity="z000000574_0133" pid="uva-lib:244585"/>
old Marheyo's larder, fearful perhaps that without this <reg orig="precau-|tion">precaution</reg> <lb/>
his guests might not fare as well as they could desire.</p>
<p>As soon as I descended from the pi-pi, the procession formed <lb/>
anew, enclosing us in its centre; where I remained part of the <lb/>
time, carried by Kory-Kory, and occasionally relieving him from <lb/>
his burden by limping along with a spear. When we moved off <lb/>
in this order, the natives struck up a musical recitative, which, <lb/>
with various alternations, they continued until we arrived at the <lb/>
place of our destination.</p>
<p>As we proceeded on our way, bands of young girls, darting <lb/>
from the surrounding groves, hung upon our skirts, and <reg orig="accom-|panied">accompanied</reg> <lb/>
us with shouts of merriment and delight, which almost <lb/>
drowned the deep notes of the recitative. On approaching old <lb/>
Marheyo's domicile, its inmates rushed out to receive us; and <lb/>
while the gifts of Mehevi were being disposed of, the <reg orig="superan-|nuated">superannuated</reg> <lb/>
warrior did the honours of his mansion with all the <lb/>
warmth of hospitality evinced by an English squire when he <lb/>
regales his friends at some fine old patrimonial mansion.</p>

<p rend="center">Attempt to procure Relief from Nukuheva&mdash;Perilous Adventure of Toby in <lb/>
the Happar Mountain&mdash;Eloquence of Kory-Kory.</p>
</argument>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Amidst</hi> these novel scenes a week passed away almost <reg orig="imper-|ceptibly">imperceptibly</reg>. <lb/>
The natives, actuated by some mysterious impulse, <lb/>
day after day redoubled their attentions to us. Their manner <lb/>
towards us was unaccountable. Surely, thought I, they would <lb/>
not act thus if they meant us any harm. But why this excess <lb/>
of deferential kindness, or what equivalent can they imagine us <lb/>
capable of rendering them for it?</p>
<p>We were fairly puzzled. But despite the apprehensions I could <lb/>
not dispel, the horrible character imputed to these Typees <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
to me wholly undeserved.</p>
<p>"Why, they are cannibals!" said Toby on one occasion when <lb/>
I eulogised the tribe. "Granted," I replied, "but a more <lb/>
humane, gentlemanly, and amiable set of epicures do not <reg orig="pro-|bably">probably</reg> <lb/>
exist in the Pacific."</p>
<p>But, notwithstanding the kind treatment we received, I was <lb/>
too familiar with the fickle disposition of savages not to feel <lb/>
anxious to withdraw from the valley, and put myself beyond the <lb/>
reach of that fearful death which, under all these smiling <reg orig="ap-|pearances">appearances</reg>, <lb/>
might yet menace us. But here there was an obstacle <lb/>
in the way of doing so. It was idle for me to think of moving <lb/>
from the place until I should have recovered from the severe <lb/>
lameness that afflicted me; indeed my malady began seriously <lb/>
to alarm me; for, despite the herbal remedies of the natives, it <lb/>
continued to grow worse and worse. Their mild applications, <lb/>
though they soothed the pain, did not remove the disorder, and <lb/>
I felt convinced that without better aid I might anticipate long <lb/>
and acute suffering.</p>
<p>But how was this aid to be procured? From the surgeons of <lb/>
the French fleet, which probably still lay in the bay of <reg orig="Nuku-|heva">Nukuheva</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="108" entity="z000000574_0135" pid="uva-lib:244587"/>
it might easily have been obtained, could I have made my <lb/>
case known to them. But how could that be effected?</p>
<p>At last, in the exigency to which I was reduced, I proposed <lb/>
to Toby that he should endeavour to go round to Nukuheva, <lb/>
and if he could not succeed in returning to the valley by <lb/>
water, in one of the boats of the squadron, and taking me off, <lb/>
he might at least procure me some proper medicines, and effect <lb/>
his return overland.</p>
<p>My companion listened to me in silence, and at first did not <lb/>
appear to relish the idea. The truth was, he felt impatient to <lb/>
escape from the place, and wished to avail himself of our present <lb/>
high favour with the natives to make good our retreat, before <lb/>
we should experience some sudden alteration in their behaviour. <lb/>
As he could not think of leaving me in my helpless condition, <lb/>
he implored me to be of good cheer, assured me that I should <lb/>
soon be better, and enabled in a few days to return with him to <lb/>
Nukuheva.</p>
<p>Added to this, he could not bear the idea of again returning <lb/>
to this dangerous place; and as for the expectation of persuading <lb/>
the Frenchmen to detach a boat's crew for the purpose of <reg orig="rescu-|ing">rescuing</reg> <lb/>
me from the Typees, he looked upon it as idle; and with <lb/>
arguments that I could not answer, urged the improbability of <lb/>
their provoking the hostilities of the clan by any such measure; <lb/>
especially as, for the purpose of quieting its apprehensions, they <lb/>
had as yet refrained from making any visit to the bay. "And <lb/>
even should they consent," said Toby, "they would only <reg orig="pro-|duce">produce</reg> <lb/>
a commotion in the valley, in which we might both be <lb/>
sacrificed by these ferocious islanders." This was unanswerable; <lb/>
but still I clung to the belief that he might succeed in <reg orig="accom-|plishing">accomplishing</reg> <lb/>
the other part of my plan; and at last I overcame his <lb/>
scruples, and he agreed to make the attempt.</p>
<p>As soon as we succeeded in making the natives understand <lb/>
our intention, they broke out into the most vehement opposition <lb/>
to the measure, and for a while I almost despaired of obtaining <lb/>
their consent. At the bare thought of one of us leaving them, <lb/>
they manifested the most lively concern. The grief and <reg orig="con-|sternation">consternation</reg> <lb/>
of Kory-Kory, in particular, was unbounded; he <lb/>
threw himself into a perfect paroxysm of gestures, which were <lb/>
intended to convey to us not only his abhorrence of Nukuheva <lb/>
<pb n="109" entity="z000000574_0136" pid="uva-lib:244588"/>
and its uncivilized inhabitants, but also his astonishment that <lb/>
after becoming acquainted with the enlightened Typees, we should <lb/>
evince the least desire to withdraw, even for a time, from their <lb/>
agreeable society.</p>
<p>However, I overbore his objections by appealing to my <reg orig="lame-|ness">lameness</reg>; <lb/>
from which I assured the natives I should speedily recover, <lb/>
if Toby were permitted to obtain the supplies I needed.</p>
<p>It was agreed that on the following morning my companion <lb/>
should depart, accompanied by some one or two of the household, <lb/>
who should point out to him an easy route, by which the bay <lb/>
might be reached before sunset.</p>
<p>At early dawn of the next day, our habitation was astir. One <lb/>
of the young men mounted into an adjoining cocoa-nut tree, <lb/>
and threw down a number of the young fruit, which old <lb/>
Marheyo quickly stripped of the green husks, and strung <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg> <lb/>
upon a short pole. These were intended to refresh Toby <lb/>
on his route.</p>
<p>The preparations being completed, with no little emotion I <lb/>
bade my companion adieu. He promised to return in three days <lb/>
at farthest; and, bidding me keep up my spirits in the interval, <lb/>
turned round the corner of the pi-pi, and, under the guidance of <lb/>
the venerable Marheyo, was soon out of sight. His departure <lb/>
oppressed me with melancholy, and, re-entering the dwelling, I <lb/>
threw myself almost in despair upon the matting of the floor.</p>
<p>In two hours' time the old warrior returned, and gave me to <lb/>
understand that, after accompanying my companion a little <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg>, <lb/>
and showing him the route, he had left him journeying on <lb/>
his way.</p>
<p>It was about noon of this same day, a season which these people <lb/>
are wont to pass in sleep, that I lay in the house, surrounded by <lb/>
its slumbering inmates, and painfully affected by the strange <lb/>
silence which prevailed. All at once I thought I heard a faint <lb/>
shout, as if proceeding from some persons in the depth of the <lb/>
grove which extended in front of our habitation.</p>
<p>The sounds grew louder and nearer, and gradually the whole <lb/>
valley rang with wild outcries. The sleepers around me started <lb/>
to their feet in alarm, and hurried outside to discover the cause <lb/>
of the commotion. Kory-Kory, who had been the first to spring <lb/>
up, soon returned almost breathless, and nearly frantic with the <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="z000000574_0137" pid="uva-lib:244589"/>
excitement under which he seemed to be labouring. All that I <lb/>
could understand from him was that some accident had happened <lb/>
to Toby. Apprehensive of some dreadful calamity, I rushed out <lb/>
of the house, and caught sight of a tumultuous crowd, who, with <lb/>
shrieks and lamentations, were just emerging from the grove <lb/>
bearing in their arms some object, the sight of which produced <lb/>
all this transport of sorrow. As they drew near, the men <reg orig="re-|doubled">redoubled</reg> <lb/>
their cries, while the girls, tossing their bare arms in <lb/>
the air, exclaimed plaintively, "Awha! awha! Toby muckee <lb/>
moee!"&mdash;Alas! alas! Toby is killed!</p>
<p>In a moment the crowd opened, and disclosed the apparently <lb/>
lifeless body of my companion borne between two men, the <lb/>
head hanging heavily against the breast of the foremost. The <lb/>
whole face, neck, and bosom were covered with blood, which <lb/>
still trickled slowly from a wound behind the temple. In the <lb/>
midst of the greatest uproar and confusion the body was carried <lb/>
into the house and laid on a mat. Waving the natives off to give <lb/>
room and air, I bent eagerly over Toby, and, laying my hand <lb/>
upon the breast, ascertained that the heart still beat. <reg orig="Over-|joyed">Overjoyed</reg> <lb/>
at this, I seized a calabash of water, and dashed its contents <lb/>
upon his face, then wiping away the blood, anxiously examined <lb/>
the wound. It was about three inches long, and on removing the <lb/>
clotted hair from about it, showed the skull laid completely bare. <lb/>
Immediately with my knife I cut away the heavy locks, and <lb/>
bathed the part repeatedly in water.</p>
<p>In a few moments Toby revived, and opening his eyes for a <lb/>
second, closed them again without speaking. Kory-Kory, who <lb/>
had been kneeling beside me, now chafed his limbs gently with <lb/>
the palms of his hands, while a young girl at his head kept <lb/>
fanning him, and I still continued to moisten his lips and brow. <lb/>
Soon my poor comrade showed signs of animation, and I <reg orig="suc-|ceeded">succeeded</reg> <lb/>
in making him swallow from a cocoa-nut shell a few <lb/>
mouthfuls of water.</p>
<p>Old Tinor now appeared, holding in her hand some simples <lb/>
she had gathered, the juice of which, she by signs besought me <lb/>
to squeeze into the wound. Having done so, I thought it best to <lb/>
leave Toby undisturbed until he should have had time to rally <lb/>
his faculties. Several times he opened his lips, but fearful for <lb/>
his safety I enjoined silence. In the course of two or three hours, <lb/>
<pb n="111" entity="z000000574_0138" pid="uva-lib:244590"/>
however, he sat up, and was sufficiently recovered to tell me <lb/>
what had occurred.</p>
<p>"After leaving the house with Marheyo," said Toby, "we <lb/>
struck across the valley, and ascended the opposite heights. Just <lb/>
beyond them, my guide informed me, lay the valley of Happar, <lb/>
while along their summits, and skirting the head of the vale, was <lb/>
my route to Nukuheva. After mounting a little way up the <lb/>
elevation my guide paused, and gave me to understand that he <lb/>
could not accompany me any farther, and by various signs <reg orig="inti-|mated">intimated</reg> <lb/>
that he was afraid to approach any nearer the territories <lb/>
of the enemies of his tribe. He however pointed out my path, <lb/>
which now lay clearly before me, and bidding me farewell hastily <lb/>
descended the mountain.</p>
<p>"Quite elated at being so near the Happars, I pushed up the <lb/>
acclivity, and soon gained its summit. It tapered up to a sharp <lb/>
ridge, from whence I beheld both the hostile valleys. Here I <lb/>
sat down and rested for a moment, refreshing myself with my <lb/>
cocoa nuts. I was soon again pursuing my way along the height, <lb/>
when suddenly I saw three of the islanders, who must have just <lb/>
come out of Happar valley, standing in the path ahead of me. <lb/>
They were each armed with a heavy spear, and one from his <reg orig="ap-|pearance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
I took to be a chief. They sung out something, I <lb/>
could not understand what, and beckoned me to come on.</p>
<p>"Without the least hesitation I advanced towards them, and had <lb/>
approached within about a yard of the foremost, when, pointing <lb/>
angrily into the Typee valley, and uttering some savage <reg orig="excla-|mation">exclamation</reg>, <lb/>
he wheeled round his weapon like lightning, and struck <lb/>
me in a moment to the ground. The blow inflicted this wound, <lb/>
and took away my senses. As soon as I came to myself, I <reg orig="per-|ceived">perceived</reg> <lb/>
the three islanders standing a little distance off, and <reg orig="ap-|parently">apparently</reg> <lb/>
engaged in some violent altercation respecting me.</p>
<p>"My first impulse was to run for it; but, in endeavouring to <lb/>
rise, I fell back, and rolled down a little grassy precipice. The <lb/>
shock seemed to rally my faculties; so, starting to my feet, I fled <lb/>
down the path I had just ascended. I had no need to look <reg orig="be-|hind">behind</reg> <lb/>
me, for, from the yells I heard, I knew that my enemies were <lb/>
in full pursuit. Urged on by their fearful outcries, and heedless <lb/>
of the injury I had received&mdash;though the blood flowing from the <lb/>
wound trickled over into my eyes and almost blinded me&mdash;I <lb/>
<pb n="112" entity="z000000574_0139" pid="uva-lib:244591"/>
rushed down the mountain side with the speed of the wind. In <lb/>
a short time I had descended nearly a third of the distance, and <lb/>
the savages had ceased their cries, when suddenly a terrific howl <lb/>
burst upon my ear, and at the same moment a heavy javelin <lb/>
darted past me as I fled, and stuck quivering in a tree close to <lb/>
me. Another yell followed, and a second spear and a third shot <lb/>
through the air within a few feet of my body, both of them <lb/>
piercing the ground obliquely in advance of me. The fellows <lb/>
gave a roar of rage and disappointment; but they were afraid, <lb/>
I suppose, of coming down further into the Typee valley, and <lb/>
so abandoned the chase. I saw them recover their weapons and <lb/>
turn back; and I continued my descent as fast as I could.</p>
<p>"What could have caused this ferocious attack on the part of <lb/>
these Happars I could not imagine, unless it were that they had <lb/>
seen me ascending the mountain with Marheyo, and that the <lb/>
mere fact of coming from the Typee valley was sufficient to <lb/>
provoke them.</p>
<p>"As long as I was in danger I scarcely felt the wound I had <lb/>
received; but when the chase was over I began to suffer from it. <lb/>
I had lost my hat in my flight, and the sun scorched my bare <lb/>
head. I felt faint and giddy; but, fearful of falling to the <lb/>
ground beyond the reach of assistance, I staggered on as well <lb/>
as I could, and at last gained the level of the valley, and then <lb/>
down I sunk; and I knew nothing more until I found myself <lb/>
lying upon these mats, and you stooping over me with the <reg orig="cala-|bash">calabash</reg> <lb/>
of water."</p>
<p>Such was Toby's account of this sad affair. I afterwards <lb/>
learned that fortunately he had fallen close to a spot where the <lb/>
natives go for fuel. A party of them caught sight of him as he <lb/>
fell, and sounding the alarm, had lifted him up; and after <reg orig="in-|effectually">ineffectually</reg> <lb/>
endeavouring to restore him at the brook, had hurried <lb/>
forward with him to the house.</p>
<p>This incident threw a dark cloud over our prospects. It <reg orig="re-|minded">reminded</reg> <lb/>
us that we were hemmed in by hostile tribes, whose <reg orig="ter-|ritories">territories</reg> <lb/>
we could not hope to pass, on our route to Nukuheva, <lb/>
without encountering the effects of their savage resentment. <lb/>
There appeared to be no avenue opened to our escape but the <lb/>
sea, which washed the lower extremity of the vale.</p>
<p>Our Typee friends availed themselves of the recent disaster of <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="z000000574_0140" pid="uva-lib:244592"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">I</fw></pb>
Toby to exhort us to a due appreciation of the blessings we <lb/>
enjoyed among them; contrasting their own generous reception <lb/>
of us with the animosity of their neighbours. They likewise <lb/>
dwelt upon the cannibal propensities of the Happars, a subject <lb/>
which they were perfectly aware could not fail to alarm us; <lb/>
while at the same time they earnestly disclaimed all participation <lb/>
in so horrid a custom. Nor did they omit to call upon us to <lb/>
admire the natural loveliness of their own abode, and the lavish <lb/>
abundance with which it produced all manner of luxuriant fruits; <lb/>
exalting it in this particular above any of the surrounding <lb/>
valleys.</p>
<p>Kory-Kory seemed to experience so heartfelt a desire to infuse <lb/>
into our minds proper views on these subjects, that, assisted in <lb/>
his endeavours by the little knowledge of the language we had <lb/>
acquired, he actually succeeded in making us comprehend a <reg orig="con-|siderable">considerable</reg> <lb/>
part of what he said. To facilitate our correct <reg orig="appre-|hension">apprehension</reg> <lb/>
of his meaning, he at first condensed his ideas into the <lb/>
smallest possible compass.</p>
<p>"Happar keekeeno nuee," he exclaimed; "nuee, nuee, ki ki <lb/>
kannaka!&mdash;ah! owle motarkee!" which signifies, "Terrible <reg orig="fel-|lows">fellows</reg> <lb/>
those Happars!&mdash;devour an amazing quantity of men!&mdash; <lb/>
ah, shocking bad!" Thus far he explained himself by a variety <lb/>
of gestures, during the performance of which he would dart out <lb/>
of the house, and point abhorrently towards the Happar valley; <lb/>
running in to us again with a rapidity that showed he was fearful <lb/>
we would lose one part of his meaning before he could <reg orig="com-|plete">complete</reg> <lb/>
the other; and continuing his illustrations by seizing the <lb/>
fleshy part of my arm in his teeth, intimating by the operation <lb/>
that the people who lived over in that direction would like <lb/>
nothing better than to treat me in that manner.</p>
<p>Having assured himself that we were fully enlightened on this <lb/>
point, he proceeded to another branch of his subject. "Ah! <lb/>
Typee motarkee!&mdash;nuee, nuee mioree&mdash;nuee, nuee wai&mdash;nuee, <lb/>
nuee poee-poee&mdash;nuee, nuee kokoo&mdash;ah! nuee, nuee kiki&mdash;ah! <lb/>
nuee, nuee, nuee!" Which, literally interpreted as before, would <lb/>
imply, "Ah, Typee! isn't it a fine place though!&mdash;no danger of <lb/>
starving here, I tell you!&mdash;plenty of bread-fruit&mdash;plenty of <lb/>

commentary of signs and gestures which it was impossible not to <lb/>

<p>As he continued his harangue, however, Kory-Kory, in <reg orig="emu-|lation">emulation</reg> <lb/>

upon the moral reflections it suggested; and proceeded in such <lb/>

gave me the headache for the rest of the day.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the course of a few days Toby had recovered from the effects <lb/>
of his adventure with the Happar warriors; the wound on his <lb/>
head rapidly healing under the vegetable treatment of the good <lb/>
Tinor. Less fortunate than my companion, however, I still <lb/>
continued to languish under a complaint the origin and nature of <lb/>
which were still a mystery. Cut off as I was from all <reg orig="inter-|course">intercourse</reg> <lb/>
with the civilized world, and feeling the inefficiency of <lb/>
anything the natives could do to relieve me; knowing too, that <lb/>
so long as I remained in my present condition, it would be <reg orig="im-|possible">impossible</reg> <lb/>
for me to leave the valley, whatever opportunity might <lb/>
present itself; and apprehensive that ere long we might be <reg orig="ex-|posed">exposed</reg> <lb/>
to some caprice on the part of the islanders, I now gave <lb/>
up all hopes of recovery, and became a prey to the most gloomy <lb/>
thoughts. A deep dejection fell upon me, which neither the <lb/>
friendly remonstrances of my companion, the devoted attentions <lb/>
of Kory-Kory, nor all the soothing influences of Fayaway could <lb/>
remove.</p>
<p>One morning as I lay on the mats in the house, plunged in <lb/>
melancholy reverie, and regardless of everything around me, <lb/>
Toby, who had left me about an hour, returned in haste, and <lb/>
with great glee told me to cheer up and be of good heart; for he <lb/>
believed, from what was going on among the natives, that there <lb/>
were boats approaching the bay.</p>
<p>These tidings operated upon me like magic. The hour of our <lb/>
deliverance was at hand, and starting up, I was soon convinced <lb/>
that something unusual was about to occur. The word "botee! <lb/>
botee!" was vociferated in all directions; and shouts were heard <lb/>
in the distance, at first feebly and faintly; but growing louder <lb/>
<pb n="116" entity="z000000574_0143" pid="uva-lib:244595"/>
and nearer at each successive repetition, until they were caught <lb/>
up by a fellow in a cocoa-nut tree a few yards off, who sounding <lb/>
them in turn, they were reiterated from a neighbouring grove, <lb/>
and so died away gradually from point to point, as the <reg orig="intelli-|gence">intelligence</reg> <lb/>
penetrated into the farthest recesses of the valley. This <lb/>
was the vocal telegraph of the islanders; by means of which <lb/>
condensed items of information could be carried in a very few <lb/>
minutes from the sea to their remotest habitation, a distance of <lb/>
at least eight or nine miles. On the present occasion it was in <lb/>
active operation; one piece of information following another <lb/>
with inconceivable rapidity.</p>
<p>The greatest commotion now appeared to prevail. At every <lb/>
fresh item of intelligence the natives betrayed the liveliest <reg orig="in-|terest">interest</reg>, <lb/>
and redoubled the energy with which they employed <lb/>
themselves in collecting fruit to sell to the expected visitors. <lb/>
Some were tearing off the husks from cocoa-nuts; some perched <lb/>
in the trees were throwing down bread-fruit to their companions, <lb/>
who gathered them into heaps as they fell; while others were <lb/>
plying their fingers rapidly in weaving leafen baskets in which to <lb/>
carry the fruit.</p>
<p>There were other matters too going on at the same time. <lb/>
Here you would see a stout warrior polishing his spear with a <lb/>
bit of old tappa, or adjusting the folds of the girdle about his <lb/>
waist; and there you might descry a young damsel decorating <lb/>
herself with flowers, as if having in her eye some maidenly <reg orig="con-|quest">conquest</reg>; <lb/>
while, as in all cases of hurry and confusion in every part <lb/>
of the world, a number of individuals kept hurrying to and fro, <lb/>
with amazing vigour and perseverance, doing nothing themselves, <lb/>
and hindering others.</p>
<p>Never before had we seen the islanders in such a state of <lb/>
bustle and excitement; and the scene furnished abundant <reg orig="evi-|dence">evidence</reg> <lb/>
of the fact&mdash;that it was only at long intervals any such <lb/>
events occur.</p>
<p>When I thought of the length of time that might intervene <lb/>
before a similar chance of escape would be presented, I bitterly <lb/>
lamented that I had not the power of availing myself effectually <lb/>
of the present opportunity.</p>
<p>From all that we could gather, it appeared that the natives <lb/>
were fearful of arriving too late upon the beach, unless they <lb/>
<pb n="117" entity="z000000574_0144" pid="uva-lib:244596"/>
made extraordinary exertions. Sick and lame as I was, I would <lb/>
have started with Toby at once, had not Kory-Kory not only <reg orig="re-|fused">refused</reg> <lb/>
to carry me, but manifested the most invincible repugnance <lb/>
to our leaving the neighbourhood of the house. The rest of the <lb/>
savages were equally opposed to our wishes, and seemed grieved <lb/>
and astonished at the earnestness of my solicitations. I clearly <lb/>
perceived that while my attendant avoided all appearance of <lb/>
constraining my movements, he was nevertheless determined to <lb/>
thwart my wish. He seemed to me on this particular occasion, <lb/>
as well as often afterwards, to be executing the orders of some <lb/>
other person with regard to me, though at the same time feeling <lb/>
towards me the most lively affection.</p>
<p>Toby, who had made up his mind to accompany the islanders <lb/>
if possible, as soon as they were in readiness to depart, and who <lb/>
for that reason had refrained from showing the same anxiety <lb/>
that I had done, now represented to me that it was idle for me <lb/>
to entertain the hope of reaching the beach in time to profit by <lb/>
any opportunity that might then be presented.</p>
<p>"Do you not see," said he, "the savages themselves are <reg orig="fear-|ful">fearful</reg> <lb/>
of being too late, and I should hurry forward myself at once <lb/>
did I not think that if I showed too much eagerness I should <lb/>
destroy all our hopes of reaping any benefit from this fortunate <lb/>
event. If you will only endeavour to appear tranquil or <reg orig="un-|concerned">unconcerned</reg>, <lb/>
you will quiet their suspicions, and I have no doubt <lb/>
they will then let me go with them to the beach, supposing that <lb/>
I merely go out of curiosity. Should I succeed in getting down <lb/>
to the boats, I will make known the condition in which I have <lb/>
left you, and measures may then be taken to secure our escape."</p>
<p>In the expediency of this I could not but acquiesce; and as <lb/>
the natives had now completed their preparations, I watched <lb/>
with the liveliest interest the reception that Toby's application <lb/>
might meet with. As soon as they understood from my <reg orig="com-|panion">companion</reg> <lb/>
that I intended to remain, they appeared to make no <lb/>
objection to his proposition, and even hailed it with pleasure. <lb/>
Their singular conduct on this occasion not a little puzzled me <lb/>
at the time, and imparted to subsequent events an additional <lb/>
mystery.</p>
<p>The islanders were now to be seen hurrying along the path <lb/>
which led to the sea. I shook Toby warmly by the hand, and <lb/>
<pb n="118" entity="z000000574_0145" pid="uva-lib:244597"/>
gave him my Payta hat to shield his wounded head from the <lb/>
sun, as he had lost his own. He cordially returned the pressure <lb/>
of my hand, and solemnly promising to return as soon as the <lb/>
boats should leave the shore, sprang from my side, and the next <lb/>
minute disappeared in a turn of the grove.</p>
<p>In spite of the unpleasant reflections that crowded upon my <lb/>
mind, I could not but be entertained by the novel and animated <lb/>
sight which now met my view. One after another the natives <lb/>
crowded along the narrow path, laden with every variety of <lb/>
fruit. Here, you might have seen one, who, after ineffectually <lb/>
endeavouring to persuade a surly porker to be conducted in <reg orig="lead-|ing">leading</reg> <lb/>
strings, was obliged at last to seize the perverse animal in <lb/>
his arms, and carry him struggling against his naked breast, and <lb/>
squealing without intermission. There went two, who at a <lb/>
little distance might have been taken for the Hebrew spies, on <lb/>
their return to Moses with the goodly bunch of grapes. One <lb/>
trotted before the other at a distance of a couple of yards, while <lb/>
between them, from a pole resting on their shoulders, was <reg orig="sus-|pended">suspended</reg> <lb/>
a huge cluster of banannas, which swayed to and fro <lb/>
with the rocking gait at which they proceeded. Here ran <lb/>
another, perspiring with his exertions, and bearing before him a <lb/>
quantity of cocoa-nuts, who, fearful of being too late, heeded <lb/>
not the fruit that dropped from his basket, and appeared solely <lb/>
intent upon reaching his destination, careless how many of his <lb/>
cocoa-nuts kept company with him.</p>
<p>In a short time the last straggler was seen hurrying on his <lb/>
way, and the faint shouts of those in advance died insensibly <lb/>
upon the ear. Our part of the valley now appeared nearly <reg orig="de-|serted">deserted</reg> <lb/>
by its inhabitants, Kory-Kory, his aged father, and a few <lb/>
decrepid old people being all that were left.</p>
<p>Towards sunset the islanders in small parties began to return <lb/>
from the beach, and among them, as they drew near to the house, <lb/>
I sought to descry the form of my companion. But one after <lb/>
another they passed the dwelling, and I caught no glimpse of <lb/>
him. Supposing, however, that he would soon appear with <lb/>
some of the members of the household, I quieted my <reg orig="appre-|hensions">apprehensions</reg>, <lb/>
and waited patiently to see him advancing in company <lb/>
with the beautiful Fayaway. At last, I perceived Tinor coming <lb/>
forward, followed by the girls and young men who usually <reg orig="re-|sided">resided</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="119" entity="z000000574_0146" pid="uva-lib:244598"/>
in the house of Marheyo; but with them came not my <lb/>
comrade, and, filled with a thousand alarms, I eagerly sought to <lb/>
discover the cause of his delay.</p>
<p>My earnest questions appeared to embarrass the natives greatly. <lb/>
All their accounts were contradictory: one giving me to <reg orig="under-|stand">understand</reg> <lb/>
that Toby would be with me in a very short time; another <lb/>
that he did not know where he was; while a third, violently <reg orig="in-|veighing">inveighing</reg> <lb/>
against him, assured me that he had stolen away, and <lb/>
would never come back. It appeared to me, at the time, that in <lb/>
making these various statements they endeavoured to conceal <lb/>
from me some terrible disaster, lest the knowledge of it should <lb/>
overpower me.</p>
<p>Fearful lest some fatal calamity had overtaken him, I sought <lb/>
out young Fayaway, and endeavoured to learn from her, if <lb/>
possible, the truth.</p>
<p>This gentle being had early attracted my regard, not only <lb/>
from her extraordinary beauty, but from the attractive cast of <lb/>
her countenance, singularly expressive of intelligence and <lb/>
humanity. Of all the natives she alone seemed to appreciate <lb/>
the effect which the peculiarity of the circumstances in which <lb/>
we were placed had produced upon the minds of my companion <lb/>
and myself. In addressing me&mdash;especially when I lay reclining <lb/>
upon the mats suffering from pain&mdash;there was a tenderness in her <lb/>
manner which it was impossible to misunderstand or resist. <lb/>
Whenever she entered the house, the expression of her face <lb/>
indicated the liveliest sympathy for me; and moving towards <lb/>
the place where I lay, with one arm slightly elevated in a <lb/>
gesture of pity, and her large glistening eyes gazing intently <lb/>
into mine, she would murmur plaintively, "Awha! awha! <lb/>
Tommo," and seat herself mournfully beside me.</p>
<p>Her manner convinced me that she deeply compassionated my <lb/>
situation, as being removed from my country and friends, and <lb/>
placed beyond the reach of all relief. Indeed, at times I was <lb/>
almost led to believe that her mind was swayed by gentle <lb/>
impulses hardly to be anticipated from one in her condition; <lb/>
that she appeared to be conscious there were ties rudely severed, <lb/>
which had once bound us to our homes; that there were sisters <lb/>
and brothers anxiously looking forward to our return, who were, <lb/>
perhaps, never more to behold us.</p>
<pb n="120" entity="z000000574_0147" pid="uva-lib:244599"/>
<p>In this amiable light did Fayaway appear in my eyes; and <lb/>
reposing full confidence in her candour and intelligence, I now <lb/>
had recourse to her, in the midst of my alarm, with regard to <lb/>
my companion.</p>
<p>My questions evidently distressed her. She looked round <lb/>
from one to another of the byestanders, as if hardly knowing <lb/>
what answer to give me. At last, yielding to my importunities, <lb/>
she overcame her scruples, and gave me to understand that Toby <lb/>
had gone away with the boats which had visited the bay, but <lb/>
had promised to return at the expiration of three days. At first <lb/>
I accused him of perfidiously deserting me; but as I grew more <lb/>
composed, I upbraided myself for imputing so cowardly an <lb/>
action to him, and tranquillized myself with the belief that he <lb/>
had availed himself of the opportunity to go round to Nukuheva, <lb/>
in order to make some arrangement by which I could be removed <lb/>
from the valley. At any rate, thought I, he will return with <lb/>
the medicines I require, and then, as soon as I recover, there <lb/>
will be no difficulty in the way of our departure.</p>
<p>Consoling myself with these reflections, I lay down that night <lb/>
in a happier frame of mind than I had done for some time. The <lb/>
next day passed without any allusion to Toby on the part of the <lb/>
natives, who seemed desirous of avoiding all reference to the <lb/>
subject. This raised some apprehensions in my breast; but <lb/>
when night came, I congratulated myself that the second day <lb/>
had now gone by, and that on the morrow Toby would again be <lb/>
with me. But the morrow came and went, and my companion <lb/>
did not appear. Ah! thought I, he reckons three days from the <lb/>
morning of his departure,&mdash;to-morrow he will arrive. But that <lb/>
weary day also closed upon me, without his return. Even yet <lb/>
I would not despair; I thought that something detained him&mdash; <lb/>
that he was waiting for the sailing of a boat, at Nukuheva, and <lb/>
that in a day or two at farthest I should see him again. But <lb/>
day after day of renewed disappointment passed by; at last hope <lb/>
deserted me, and I fell a victim to despair.</p>
<p>Yes, thought I, gloomily, he has secured his own escape, and <lb/>
cares not what calamity may befall his unfortunate comrade. <lb/>
Fool that I was, to suppose that any one would willingly <lb/>
encounter the perils of this valley, after having once got beyond <lb/>
its limits! He has gone, and has left me to combat alone all the <lb/>
<pb n="121" entity="z000000574_0148" pid="uva-lib:244600"/>
dangers by which I am surrounded. Thus would I sometimes <lb/>
seek to derive a desperate consolation from dwelling upon the <lb/>
perfidy of Toby: whilst at other times I sunk under the bitter <lb/>
remorse which I felt as having by my own imprudence brought <lb/>
upon myself the fate which I was sure awaited me.</p>
<p>At other times I thought that perhaps after all these <reg orig="treacher-|ous">treacherous</reg> <lb/>
savages have made away with him, and thence the confusion <lb/>
into which they were thrown by my questions, and their <reg orig="contra-|dictory">contradictory</reg> <lb/>
answers, or he might be a captive in some other part of <lb/>
the valley; or, more dreadful still, might have met with that fate <lb/>
at which my very soul shuddered. But all these speculations <lb/>
were vain; no tidings of Toby ever reached me; he had gone <lb/>
never to return.</p>
<p>The conduct of the islanders appeared inexplicable. All <reg orig="re-|ference">reference</reg> <lb/>
to my lost comrade was carefully evaded, and if at any <lb/>
time they were forced to make some reply to my frequent <reg orig="in-|quiries">inquiries</reg> <lb/>
on the subject, they would uniformly denounce him as an <lb/>
ungrateful runaway, who had deserted his friend, and taken <lb/>
himself off to that vile and detestable place Nukuheva.</p>
<p>But whatever might have been his fate, now that he was gone, <lb/>
the natives multiplied their acts of kindness and attention towards <lb/>
myself, treating me with a degree of deference which could hardly <lb/>
have been surpassed had I been some celestial visitant. <reg orig="Kory-|Kory">Kory-Kory</reg> <lb/>
never for one moment left my side, unless it were to <reg orig="exe-|cute">execute</reg> <lb/>
my wishes. The faithful fellow, twice every day, in the <lb/>
cool of the morning and in the evening, insisted upon carrying <lb/>
me to the stream, and bathing me in its refreshing water.</p>
<p>Frequently in the afternoon he would carry me to a particular <lb/>
part of the stream, where the beauty of the scene produced a <lb/>
soothing influence upon my mind. At this place the waters <lb/>
flowed between grassy banks, planted with enormous bread-fruit <lb/>
trees, whose vast branches interlacing overhead, formed a leafy <lb/>
canopy; near the stream were several smooth black rocks. One <lb/>
of these, projecting several feet above the surface of the water, <lb/>
had upon its summit a shallow cavity, which, filled with <reg orig="freshly-|gathered">freshly-gathered</reg> <lb/>
leaves, formed a delightful couch.</p>
<p>Here I often lay for hours, covered with a gauze-like veil of <lb/>
tappa, while Fayaway, seated beside me, and holding in her hand <lb/>
a fan woven from the leaflets of a young cocoa-nut bough, brushed <lb/>
<pb n="122" entity="z000000574_0149" pid="uva-lib:244601"/>
aside the insects that occasionally lighted on my face, and <reg orig="Kory-|Kory">Kory-Kory</reg>, <lb/>
with a view of chasing away my melancholy, performed a <lb/>
thousand antics in the water before us.</p>
<p>As my eye wandered along this romantic stream, it would fall <lb/>
upon the half-immersed figure of a beautiful girl, standing in the <lb/>
transparent water, and catching in a little net a species of <reg orig="dimi-|nutive">diminutive</reg> <lb/>
shell-fish, of which these people are extravagantly fond. <lb/>
Sometimes a chattering group would be seated upon the edge of <lb/>
a low rock in the midst of the brook, busily engaged in thinning <lb/>
and polishing the shells of cocoa-nuts, by rubbing them briskly <lb/>
with a small stone in the water, an operation which soon <reg orig="con-|verts">converts</reg> <lb/>
them into a light and elegant drinking vessel, somewhat <lb/>
resembling goblets made of tortoiseshell.</p>
<p>But the tranquillizing influences of beautiful scenery, and the <lb/>
exhibition of human life under so novel and charming an aspect, <lb/>
were not my only sources of consolation.</p>
<p>Every evening the girls of the house gathered about me on the <lb/>
mats, and after chasing away Kory-Kory from my side&mdash;who, <lb/>
nevertheless, retired only to a little distance and watched their <lb/>
proceedings with the most jealous attention&mdash;would anoint my <lb/>
whole body with a fragrant oil, squeezed from a yellow root, <lb/>
previously pounded between a couple of stones, and which in <lb/>
their language is denominated "aka." And most refreshing and <lb/>
agreeable are the juices of the "aka," when applied to one's <lb/>
limbs by the soft palms of sweet nymphs, whose bright eyes are <lb/>
beaming upon you with kindness; and I used to hail with <reg orig="de-|light">delight</reg> <lb/>
the daily recurrence of this luxurious operation, in which I <lb/>
forgot all my troubles, and buried for the time every feeling of <lb/>
sorrow.</p>
<p>Sometimes in the cool of the evening my devoted servitor <lb/>
would lead me out upon the pi-pi in front of the house, and <reg orig="seat-|ing">seating</reg> <lb/>
me near its edge, protect my body from the annoyances of <lb/>
the insects which occasionally hovered in the air, by wrapping me <lb/>
round with a large roll of tappa. He then bustled about, and <lb/>
employed himself at least twenty minutes in adjusting everything <lb/>
to secure my personal comfort.</p>
<p>Having perfected his arrangements, he would get my pipe, <lb/>
and, lighting it, would hand it to me. Often he was obliged to <lb/>
strike a light for the occasion, and as the mode he adopted was <lb/>
<pb n="123" entity="z000000574_0150" pid="uva-lib:244602"/>
entirely different from what I had ever seen or heard of before, <lb/>
I will describe it.</p>
<p>A straight, dry, and partly decayed stick of the Habiscus, about <lb/>
six feet in length, and half as many inches in diameter, with a <lb/>
smaller bit of wood not more than a foot long, and scarcely an <lb/>
inch wide, is as invariably to be met with in every house in <lb/>
Typee as a box of lucifer matches in the corner of a kitchen <reg orig="cup-|board">cupboard</reg> <lb/>
at home.</p>
<p>The islander, placing the larger stick obliquely against some <lb/>
object, with one end elevated at an angle of forty-five degrees, <lb/>
mounts astride of it like an urchin about to gallop off upon a <lb/>
cane, and then grasping the smaller one firmly in both hands, he <lb/>
rubs its pointed end slowly up and down the extent of a few <lb/>
inches on the principal stick, until at last he makes a narrow <lb/>
groove in the wood, with an abrupt termination at the point <lb/>
furthest from him, where all the dusty particles which the friction <lb/>
creates are accumulated in a little heap.</p>
<p>At first Kory-Kory goes to work quite leisurely, but gradually <lb/>
quickens his pace, and waxing warm in the employment, drives <lb/>
the stick furiously along the smoking channel, plying his hands <lb/>
to and fro with amazing rapidity, the perspiration starting from <lb/>
every pore. As he approaches the climax of his effort, he pants <lb/>
and grasps for breath, and his eyes almost start from their sockets <lb/>
with the violence of his exertions. This is the critical stage of <lb/>
the operation; all his previous labours are vain if he cannot <reg orig="sus-|tain">sustain</reg> <lb/>
the rapidity of the movement until the reluctant spark is <lb/>
produced. Suddenly he stops, becomes perfectly motionless. <lb/>
His hands still retain their hold of the smaller stick, which is <lb/>
pressed convulsively against the further end of the channel <lb/>
among the fine powder there accumulated, as if he had just <lb/>
pierced through and through some little viper that was wriggling <lb/>
and struggling to escape from his clutches. The next moment a <lb/>
delicate wreath of smoke curls spirally into the air, the heap of <lb/>
dusty particles glows with fire, and Kory-Kory almost breathless, <lb/>
dismounts from his steed.</p>
<p>This operation appeared to me to be the most laborious species <lb/>
of work performed in Typee; and had I possessed a sufficient <lb/>
intimacy with the language to have conveyed my ideas upon the <lb/>
subject, I should certainly have suggested to the most influential <lb/>
<pb n="124" entity="z000000574_0151" pid="uva-lib:244603"/>
of the natives the expediency of establishing a college of vestals <lb/>
to be centrally located in the valley, for the purpose of keeping <lb/>
alive the indispensable article of fire; so as to supersede the <reg orig="ne-|cessity">necessity</reg> <lb/>
of such a vast outlay of strength and good temper, as <lb/>
were usually squandered on these occasions. There might, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
be special difficulties in carrying this plan into execution.</p>
<p>What a striking evidence does this operation furnish of the <lb/>
wide difference between the extreme of savage and civilized life. <lb/>
A gentleman of Typee can bring up a numerous family of <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg> <lb/>
and give them all a highly respectable cannibal education, <lb/>
with infinitely less toil and anxiety than he expends in the simple <lb/>
process of striking a light; whilst a poor European artisan, who <lb/>
through the instrumentality of a lucifer performs the same <reg orig="ope-|ration">operation</reg> <lb/>
in one second, is put to his wit's end to provide for his <lb/>
starving offspring that food which the children of a Polynesian <lb/>
father, without troubling their parent, pluck from the branches <lb/>
of every tree around them.</p>

</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">All</hi> the inhabitants of the valley treated me with great <reg orig="kind-|ness">kindness</reg>; <lb/>
but as to the household of Marheyo, with whom I was now <lb/>
permanently domiciled, nothing could surpass their efforts to <lb/>
minister to my comfort. To the gratification of my palate they <lb/>
paid the most unwearied attention. They continually invited <lb/>
me to partake of food, and when after eating heartily I declined <lb/>
the viands they continued to offer me, they seemed to think that <lb/>
my appetite stood in need of some piquant stimulant to excite its <lb/>
activity.</p>
<p>In pursuance of this idea, old Marheyo himself would hie him <lb/>
away to the sea-shore by the break of day, for the purpose of <lb/>
collecting various species of rare sea-weed; some of which <lb/>
among these people are considered a great luxury. After a <lb/>
whole day spent in this employment, he would return about <lb/>
nightfall with several cocoa-nut shells filled with different <reg orig="de-|scriptions">descriptions</reg> <lb/>
of kemp. In preparing these for use he manifested all <lb/>
the ostentation of a professed cook, although the chief mystery <lb/>
of the affair appeared to consist in pouring water in judicious <lb/>
quantities upon the slimy contents of his cocoa-nut shells.</p>
<p>The first time he submitted one of these saline salads to my <lb/>
critical attention I naturally thought that anything collected at <lb/>
such pains must possess peculiar merits; but one mouthful was a <lb/>
complete dose; and great was the consternation of the old <reg orig="war-|rior">warrior</reg> <lb/>
at the rapidity with which I ejected his Epicurean treat.</p>
<p>How true it is, that the rarity of any particular article <reg orig="en-|hances">enhances</reg> <lb/>
its value amazingly. In some part of the valley&mdash;I know <lb/>
not where, but probably in the neighbourhood of the sea&mdash;the <lb/>
girls were sometimes in the habit of procuring small quantities of <lb/>
salt, a thimble-full or so being the result of the united labours <lb/>
<pb n="126" entity="z000000574_0153" pid="uva-lib:244605"/>
of a party of five or six employed for the greater part of the <lb/>
day. This precious commodity they brought to the house, <reg orig="en-|veloped">enveloped</reg> <lb/>
in multitudinous folds of leaves; and as a special mark <lb/>
of the esteem in which they held me, would spread an immense <lb/>
leaf on the ground, and dropping one by one a few minute <reg orig="par-|ticles">particles</reg> <lb/>
of the salt upon it, invite me to taste them.</p>
<p>From the extravagant value placed upon the article, I verily <lb/>
believe, that with a bushel of common Liverpool salt all the real <lb/>
estate in Typee might have been purchased. With a small pinch <lb/>
of it in one hand, and a quarter section of a bread-fruit in the <lb/>
other, the greatest chief in the valley would have laughed at all <lb/>
the luxuries of a Parisian table.</p>
<p>The celebrity of the bread-fruit tree, and the conspicuous place <lb/>
it occupies in a Typee bill of fare, induces me to give at some <lb/>
length a general description of the tree, and the various modes in <lb/>
which the fruit is prepared.</p>
<p>The bread-fruit tree, in its glorious prime, is a grand and <lb/>
towering object, forming the same feature in a Marquesan <reg orig="land-|scape">landscape</reg> <lb/>
that the patriarchal elm does in New England scenery. <lb/>
The latter tree it not a little resembles in height, in the wide <lb/>
spread of its stalwart branches, and in its venerable and imposing <lb/>
aspect.</p>
<p>The leaves of the bread-fruit are of great size, and their edges <lb/>
are cut and scolloped as fantastically as those of a lady's lace <lb/>
collar. As they annually tend towards decay, they almost rival in <lb/>
the brilliant variety of their gradually changing hues the fleeting <lb/>
shades of the expiring dolphin. The autumnal tints of our <lb/>
American forests, glorious as they are, sink into nothing in <reg orig="com-|parison">comparison</reg> <lb/>
with this tree.</p>
<p>The leaf, in one particular stage, when nearly all the prismatic <lb/>
colours are blended on its surface, is often converted by the <lb/>
natives into a superb and striking head-dress. The principal <lb/>
fibre traversing its length being split open a convenient distance, <lb/>
and the elastic sides of the aperture pressed apart, the head is <lb/>
inserted between them, the leaf drooping on one side, with its <lb/>
forward half turned jauntily up on the brows, and the remaining <lb/>
part spreading laterally behind the ears.</p>
<p>The fruit somewhat resembles in magnitude and general <reg orig="ap-|pearance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
one of our citron melons of ordinary size; but, unlike <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="z000000574_0154" pid="uva-lib:244606"/>
the citron, it has no sectional lines drawn along the outside. Its <lb/>
surface is dotted all over with little conical prominences, looking <lb/>
not unlike the knobs on an antiquated church door. The rind <lb/>
is perhaps an eighth of an inch in thickness; and denuded of this, <lb/>
at the time when it is in the greatest perfection, the fruit <reg orig="pre-|sents">presents</reg> <lb/>
a beautiful globe of white pulp, the whole of which may be <lb/>
eaten, with the exception of a slender core, which is easily <lb/>
removed.</p>
<p>The bread-fruit, however, is never used, and is indeed <reg orig="alto-|gether">altogether</reg> <lb/>
unfit to be eaten, until submitted in one form or other to <lb/>
the action of fire.</p>
<p>The most simple manner in which this operation is performed, <lb/>
and I think, the best, consists in placing any number of the freshly <lb/>
plucked fruit, when in a particular stage of greenness, among the <lb/>
embers of a fire, in the same way that you would roast a potato. <lb/>
After the lapse of ten or fifteen minutes, the green rind embrowns <lb/>
and cracks, showing through the fissures in its sides the <reg orig="milk-|white">milk-white</reg> <lb/>
interior. As soon as it cools, the rind drops off, and you <lb/>
then have the soft round pulp in its purest and most delicious <lb/>
state. Thus eaten, it has a mild and pleasing flavour.</p>
<p>Sometimes, after having been roasted in the fire, the natives <lb/>
snatch it briskly from the embers, and permitting it to slip out of <lb/>
the yielding rind into a vessel of cold water, stir up the mixture, <lb/>
which they call "bo-a-sho." I never could endure this <reg orig="com-|pound">compound</reg>, <lb/>
and indeed the preparation is not greatly in vogue among <lb/>
the more polite Typees.</p>
<p>There is one form, however, in which the fruit is occasionally <lb/>
served, that renders it a dish fit for a king. As soon as it is taken <lb/>
from the fire the exterior is removed, the core extracted, and the <lb/>
remaining part is placed in a sort of shallow stone mortar, and <lb/>
briskly worked with a pestle of the same substance. While one <lb/>
person is performing this operation, another takes a ripe <reg orig="cocoa-|nut">cocoanut</reg>, <lb/>
and breaking it in half, which they also do very cleverly, <lb/>
proceeds to grate the juicy meat into fine particles. This is <lb/>
done by means of a piece of mother-of-pearl shell, lashed firmly <lb/>
to the extreme end of a heavy stick, with its straight side <lb/>
accurately notched like a saw. The stick is sometimes a <reg orig="gro-|tesquely-formed">grotesquely-formed</reg> <lb/>
limb of a tree, with three or four branches <lb/>
twisting from its body like so many shapeless legs, and sustaining <lb/>
it two or three feet from the ground.</p>
<pb n="128" entity="z000000574_0155" pid="uva-lib:244607"/>
<p>The native, first placing a calabash beneath the nose, as it <lb/>
were, of his curious-looking log-steed, for the purpose of <reg orig="re-|ceiving">receiving</reg> <lb/>
the grated fragments as they fall, mounts astride of it as <lb/>
if it were a hobby-horse, and twirling the inside of one of his <lb/>
hemispheres of cocoa-nut around the sharp teeth of the <reg orig="mother-|of-pearl">mother-of-pearl</reg> <lb/>
shell, the pure white meat falls in snowy showers into <lb/>
the receptacle provided. Having obtained a quantity sufficient <lb/>
for his purpose, he places it in a bag made of the net-like fibrous <lb/>
substance attached to all cocoa-nut trees, and compressing it <lb/>
over the bread-fruit, which being now sufficiently pounded, is put <lb/>
into a wooden bowl&mdash;extracts a thick creamy milk. The delicious <lb/>
liquid soon bubbles round the fruit, and leaves it at last just <lb/>
peeping above its surface.</p>
<p>This preparation is called "kokoo," and a most luscious <reg orig="pre-|paration">preparation</reg> <lb/>
it is. The hobby-horse and the pestle and mortar were <lb/>
in great requisition during the time I remained in the house of <lb/>
Marheyo, and Kory-Kory had frequent occasion to show his skill <lb/>
in their use.</p>
<p>But the great staple articles of food into which the bread-fruit <lb/>
is converted by these natives are known respectively by the <lb/>
names of Amar and Poee-Poee.</p>
<p>At certain seasons of the year, when the fruit of the hundred <lb/>
groves of the valley has reached its maturity, and hangs in <lb/>
golden spheres from every branch, the islanders assemble in <lb/>
harvest groups, and garner in the abundance which surrounds <lb/>
them. The trees are stripped of their nodding burdens, which, <lb/>
easily freed from the rind and core, are gathered together in <lb/>
capacious wooden vessels, where the pulpy fruit is soon worked <lb/>
by a stone pestle, vigorously applied, into a blended mass of a <lb/>
doughy consistency, called by the natives "Tutao." This is <lb/>
then divided into separate parcels, which, after being made up <lb/>
into stout packages, enveloped in successive folds of leaves, and <lb/>
bound round with thongs of bark, are stored away in large <reg orig="re-|ceptacles">receptacles</reg> <lb/>
hollowed in the earth, from whence they are drawn as <lb/>
occasion may require.</p>
<p>In this condition the Tutao sometimes remains for years, and <lb/>
even is thought to improve by age. Before it is fit to be eaten, <lb/>
however, it has to undergo an additional process. A primitive <lb/>
oven is scooped in the ground, and its bottom being loosely <lb/>
<pb n="129" entity="z000000574_0156" pid="uva-lib:244608"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">K</fw></pb>
covered with stones, a large fire is kindled within it. As soon <lb/>
as the requisite degree of heat is attained, the embers are <reg orig="re-|moved">removed</reg>, <lb/>
and the surface of the stones being covered with thick <lb/>
layers of leaves, one of the larger packages of Tutao is deposited <lb/>
upon them, and overspread with another layer of leaves. The <lb/>
whole is then quickly heaped up with earth, and forms a sloping <lb/>
mound.</p>
<p>The Tutao thus baked is called "Amar;" the action of the <lb/>
oven having converted it into an amber-coloured caky substance, <lb/>
a little tart, but not at all disagreeable to the taste.</p>
<p>By another and final process the "Amar" is changed into <lb/>
"Poee-Poee." This transition is rapidly effected. The amar <lb/>
is placed in a vessel, and mixed with water until it gains a proper <lb/>
pudding-like consistency, when, without further preparation, it is <lb/>
in readiness for use. This is the form in which the "Tutao" is <lb/>
generally consumed. The singular mode of eating it I have <lb/>
already described.</p>
<p>Were it not that the bread-fruit is thus capable of being <reg orig="pre-|served">preserved</reg> <lb/>
for a length of time, the natives might be reduced to a <lb/>
state of starvation; for owing to some unknown cause the trees <lb/>
sometimes fail to bear fruit; and on such occasions the islanders <lb/>
chiefly depend upon the supplies they have been enabled to store <lb/>
away.</p>
<p>This stately tree, which is rarely met with upon the Sandwich <lb/>
Islands, and then only of a very inferior quality, and at Tahiti <lb/>
does not abound to a degree that renders its fruit the principal <lb/>
article of food, attains its greatest excellence in the genial <lb/>
climate of the Marquesan group, where it grows to an enormous <lb/>
magnitude, and flourishes in the utmost abundance.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> looking back to this period, and calling to remembrance the <lb/>
numberless proofs of kindness and respect which I received from <lb/>
the natives of the valley, I can scarcely understand how it was <lb/>
that, in the midst of so many consolatory circumstances, my mind <lb/>
should still have been consumed by the most dismal forebodings, <lb/>
and have remained a prey to the profoundest melancholy. It is <lb/>
true that the suspicious circumstances which had attended the <lb/>
disappearance of Toby were enough of themselves to excite <reg orig="dis-|trust">distrust</reg> <lb/>
with regard to the savages, in whose power I felt myself to <lb/>
be entirely placed, especially when it was combined with the <lb/>
knowledge that these very men, kind and respectful as they were <lb/>
to me, were, after all, nothing better than a set of cannibals.</p>
<p>But my chief source of anxiety, and that which poisoned every <lb/>
temporary enjoyment, was the mysterious disease in my leg, which <lb/>
still remained unabated. All the herbal applications of Tinor, <lb/>
united with the severer discipline of the old leech, and the <reg orig="affec-|tionate">affectionate</reg> <lb/>
nursing of Kory-Kory, had failed to relieve me. I was <lb/>
almost a cripple, and the pain I endured at intervals was <reg orig="agoniz-|ing">agonizing</reg>. <lb/>
The unaccountable malady showed no signs of amendment; <lb/>
on the contrary, its violence increased day by day, and threatened <lb/>
the most fatal results, unless some powerful means were employed <lb/>
to counteract it. It seemed as if I were destined to sink under <lb/>
this grievous affliction, or at least that it would hinder me from <lb/>
availing myself of any opportunity of escaping from the valley.</p>
<p>An incident which occurred as nearly as I can estimate about <lb/>
three weeks after the disappearance of Toby, convinced me that <lb/>
the natives, from some reason or other, would interpose every <lb/>
possible obstacle to my leaving them.</p>
<p>One morning there was no little excitement evinced by the <lb/>
<pb n="131" entity="z000000574_0158" pid="uva-lib:244610"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">K 2</fw></pb>
people near my abode, and which I soon discovered proceeded <lb/>
from a vague report that boats had been seen at a great distance <lb/>
approaching the bay. Immediately all was bustle and <reg orig="anima-|tion">animation</reg>. <lb/>
It so happened that day that the pain I suffered having <lb/>
somewhat abated, and feeling in much better spirits than usual, <lb/>
I had complied with Kory-Kory's invitation to visit the chief <lb/>
Mehevi at the place called the "Ti," which I have before <lb/>
described as being situated within the precincts of the Taboo <lb/>
Groves. These sacred recesses were at no great distance from <lb/>
Marheyo's habitation, and lay between it and the sea; the path <lb/>
that conducted to the beach passing directly in front of the Ti, <lb/>
and thence skirting along the border of the groves.</p>
<p>I was reposing upon the mats, within the sacred building, in <lb/>
company with Mehevi and several other chiefs, when the <reg orig="an-|nouncement">announcement</reg> <lb/>
was first made. It sent a thrill of joy through my <lb/>
whole frame;&mdash;perhaps Toby was about to return. I rose at <lb/>
once to my feet, and my instinctive impulse was to hurry down to <lb/>
the beach, equally regardless of the distance that separated me <lb/>
from it, and of my disabled condition. As soon as Mehevi <lb/>
noticed the effect the intelligence had produced upon me, and <lb/>
the impatience I betrayed to reach the sea, his countenance <lb/>
assumed that inflexible rigidity of expression which had so awed <lb/>
me on the afternoon of our arrival at the house of Marheyo. As <lb/>
I was proceeding to leave the Ti, he laid his hand upon my <lb/>
shoulder, and said gravely, "abo, abo" (wait, wait). Solely <lb/>
intent upon the one thought that occupied my mind, and <reg orig="heed-|less">heedless</reg> <lb/>
of his request, I was brushing past him, when suddenly he <lb/>
assumed a tone of authority, and told me to "moee" (sit down). <lb/>
Though struck by the alteration in his demeanor, the excitement <lb/>
under which I laboured was too strong to permit me to obey the <lb/>
unexpected command, and I was still limping towards the edge <lb/>
of the pi-pi with Kory-Kory clinging to one arm in his efforts to <lb/>
restrain me, when the natives around starting to their feet, <lb/>
ranged themselves along the open front of the building, while <lb/>
Mehevi looked at me scowlingly, and reiterated his commands still <lb/>
more sternly.</p>
<p>It was at this moment, when fifty savage countenances were <lb/>
glaring upon me, that I first truly experienced I was indeed a <lb/>
captive in the valley. The conviction rushed upon me with <lb/>
<pb n="132" entity="z000000574_0159" pid="uva-lib:244611"/>
staggering force, and I was overwhelmed by this confirmation of <lb/>
my worst fears. I saw at once that it was useless for me to <lb/>
resist, and sick at heart, I reseated myself upon the mats, and for <lb/>
the moment abandoned myself to despair.</p>
<p>I now perceived the natives one after the other hurrying past <lb/>
the Ti and pursuing the route that conducted to the sea. These <lb/>
savages, thought I, will soon be holding communication with <lb/>
some of my own countrymen perhaps, who with ease could <lb/>
restore me to liberty did they know of the situation I was in. <lb/>
No language can describe the wretchedness which I felt; and <lb/>
in the bitterness of my soul I imprecated a thousand curses on <lb/>
the perfidious Toby, who had thus abandoned me to destruction. <lb/>
It was in vain that Kory-Kory tempted me with food, or lighted <lb/>
my pipe, or sought to attract my attention by performing the <lb/>
uncouth antics that had sometimes diverted me. I was fairly <lb/>
knocked down by this last misfortune, which, much as I had <lb/>
feared it, I had never before had the courage calmly to <reg orig="contem-|plate">contemplate</reg>.</p>
<p>Regardless of every thing but my own sorrow, I remained in <lb/>
the Ti for several hours, until shouts proceeding at intervals <lb/>
from the groves beyond the house proclaimed the return of the <lb/>
natives from the beach.</p>
<p>Whether any boats visited the bay that morning or not, I <lb/>
never could ascertain. The savages assured me that there had <lb/>
not&mdash;but I was inclined to believe that by deceiving me in this <lb/>
particular they sought to allay the violence of my grief. <reg orig="How-|ever">However</reg> <lb/>
that might be, this incident showed plainly that the Typees <lb/>
intended to hold me a prisoner. As they still treated me with <lb/>
the same sedulous attention as before, I was utterly at a loss how <lb/>
to account for their singular conduct. Had I been in a situation <lb/>
to instruct them in any of the rudiments of the mechanic arts, <lb/>
or had I manifested a disposition to render myself in any way <lb/>
useful among them, their conduct might have been attributed <lb/>
to some adequate motive, but as it was the matter seemed to me <lb/>
inexplicable.</p>
<p>During my whole stay on the island there occurred but two <lb/>
or three instances where the natives applied to me with the view <lb/>
of availing themselves of my superior information. And these <lb/>
now appear so ludicrous that I cannot forbear relating them.</p>
<pb n="133" entity="z000000574_0160" pid="uva-lib:244612"/>
<p>The few things we had brought from Nukuheva had been <lb/>
done up into a small bundle which we had carried with us in <lb/>
our descent to the valley. This bundle, the first night of our <lb/>
arrival, I had used as a pillow, but on the succeeding morning, <lb/>
opening it for the inspection of the natives, they gazed upon the <lb/>
miscellaneous contents as though I had just revealed to them a <lb/>
casket of diamonds, and they insisted that so precious a treasure <lb/>
should be properly secured. A line was accordingly attached to <lb/>
it, and the other end being passed over the ridge-pole of the <lb/>
house, it was hoisted up to the apex of the roof, where it hung <lb/>
suspended directly over the mats where I usually reclined. <lb/>
When I desired anything from it I merely raised my finger to a <lb/>
bamboo beside me, and taking hold of the string which was <lb/>
there fastened, lowered the package. This was exceedingly <lb/>
handy, and I took care to let the natives understand how much I <lb/>
applauded the invention. Of this package the chief contents <lb/>
were a razor with its case, a supply of needles and thread, a <lb/>
pound or two of tobacco, and a few yards of a bright-coloured <lb/>
calico.</p>
<p>I should have mentioned that shortly after Toby's <reg orig="disappear-|ance">disappearance</reg>, <lb/>
perceiving the uncertainty of the time I might be obliged <lb/>
to remain in the valley&mdash;if, indeed, I ever should escape from it&mdash; <lb/>
and considering that my whole wardrobe consisted of a shirt and <lb/>
a pair of trousers, I resolved to doff these garments at once, in <lb/>
order to preserve them in a suitable condition for wear should I <lb/>
again appear among civilized beings. I was consequently obliged <lb/>
to assume the Typee costume, a little altered, however, to suit <lb/>
my own views of propriety, and in which I have no doubt I <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
to as much advantage as a senator of Rome enveloped in <lb/>
the folds of his toga. A few folds of yellow tappa tucked about <lb/>
my waist, descended to my feet in the style of a lady's petticoat, <lb/>
only I did not have recourse to those voluminous paddings in the <lb/>
rear with which our gentle dames are in the habit of augmenting <lb/>
the sublime rotundity of their figures. This usually comprised <lb/>
my in-door dress: whenever I walked out, I superadded to it an <lb/>
ample robe of the same material, which completely enveloped my <lb/>
person, and screened it from the rays of the sun.</p>
<p>One morning I made a rent in this mantle; and to show the <lb/>
<pb n="134" entity="z000000574_0161" pid="uva-lib:244613"/>
islanders with what facility it could be repaired, I lowered my <lb/>
bundle, and taking from it a needle and thread, proceeded to <lb/>
stitch up the opening. They regarded this wonderful application <lb/>
of science with intense admiration; and whilst I was stitching <lb/>
away, old Marheyo, who was one of the lookers-on, suddenly <lb/>
clapped his hand to his forehead, and rushing to a corner of the <lb/>
house, drew forth a soiled and tattered strip of faded calico&mdash;which <lb/>
he must have procured some time or other in traffic on the beach&mdash; <lb/>
and besought me eagerly to exercise a little of my art upon it. <lb/>
I willingly complied, though certainly so stumpy a needle as <lb/>
mine never took such gigantic strides over calico before. The <lb/>
repairs completed, old Marheyo gave me a paternal hug; and <lb/>
divesting himself of his "maro" (girdle), swathed the calico <lb/>
about his loins, and slipping the beloved ornaments into his ears, <lb/>
grasped his spear and sallied out of the house, like a valiant <lb/>
Templer arrayed in a new and costly suit of armour.</p>
<p>I never used my razor during my stay in the island, but, <lb/>
although a very subordinate affair, it had been vastly admired <lb/>
by the Typees; and Narmonee, a great hero among them, who <lb/>
was exceedingly precise in the arrangements of his toilet and the <lb/>
general adjustment of his person, being the most accurately <lb/>
tattooed and laboriously horrified individual in all the valley, <lb/>
thought it would be a great advantage to have it applied to the <lb/>
already shaven crown of his head.</p>
<p>The implement they usually employ is a shark's tooth, which <lb/>
is about as well adapted to the purpose as a one-pronged fork for <lb/>
pitching hay. No wonder, then, that the acute Narmonee <reg orig="per-|ceived">perceived</reg> <lb/>
the advantage my razor possessed over the usual <reg orig="imple-|ment">implement</reg>. <lb/>
Accordingly, one day he requested as a personal favour <lb/>
that I would just run over his head with the razor. In reply, <lb/>
I gave him to understand that it was too dull, and could not be <lb/>
used to any purpose without being previously sharpened. To <lb/>
assist my meaning, I went through an imaginary honing process <lb/>
on the palm of my hand. Narmonee took my meaning in an <lb/>
instant, and running out of the house, returned the next moment <lb/>
with a huge rough mass of rock as big as a milestone, and <reg orig="indi-|cated">indicated</reg> <lb/>
to me that that was exactly the thing I wanted. Of course <lb/>
there was nothing left for me but to proceed to business, and I <lb/>
<pb n="135" entity="z000000574_0162" pid="uva-lib:244614"/>
began scraping away at a great rate. He writhed and wriggled <lb/>
under the infliction, but, fully convinced of my skill, endured the <lb/>
pain like a martyr.</p>
<p>Though I never saw Narmonee in battle, I will, from what I <lb/>
then observed, stake my life upon his courage and fortitude. <lb/>
Before commencing operations, his head had presented a surface <lb/>
of short bristling hairs, and by the time I had concluded my <lb/>
unskilful operation it resembled not a little a stubble field after <lb/>
being gone over with a harrow. However, as the chief expressed <lb/>
the liveliest satisfaction at the result, I was too wise to dissent <lb/>
from his opinion.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Day</hi> after day wore on, and still there was no perceptible change <lb/>
in the conduct of the islanders towards me. Gradually I lost <lb/>
all knowledge of the regular occurrence of the days of the week, <lb/>
and sunk insensibly into that kind of apathy which ensues after <lb/>
some violent outbreak of despair. My limb suddenly healed, the <lb/>
swelling went down, the pain subsided, and I had every reason <lb/>
to suppose I should soon completely recover from the affliction <lb/>
that had so long tormented me.</p>
<p>As soon as I was enabled to ramble about the valley in <reg orig="com-|pany">company</reg> <lb/>
with the natives, troops of whom followed me whenever I <lb/>
sallied out of the house, I began to experience an elasticity of <lb/>
mind which placed me beyond the reach of those dismal <reg orig="fore-|bodings">forebodings</reg> <lb/>
to which I had so lately been a prey. Received <reg orig="where-|ever">where-ever</reg> <lb/>
I went with the most deferential kindness; regaled <reg orig="perpe-|tually">perpetually</reg> <lb/>
with the most delightful fruits; ministered to by dark-eyed <lb/>
nymphs; and enjoying besides all the services of the devoted <lb/>
Kory-Kory, I thought that for a sojourn among cannibals, no <lb/>
man could have well made a more agreeable one.</p>
<p>To be sure there were limits set to my wanderings. Toward <lb/>
the sea my progress was barred by an express prohibition of the <lb/>
savages; and after having made two or three ineffectual attempts <lb/>
to reach it, as much to gratify my curiosity as anything else, I <lb/>
gave up the idea. It was in vain to think of reaching it by <lb/>
stealth, since the natives escorted me in numbers wherever I <lb/>
went, and not for one single moment that I can recall to mind <lb/>
was I ever permitted to be alone.</p>
<p>The green and precipitous elevations that stood ranged around <lb/>
<pb n="137" entity="z000000574_0164" pid="uva-lib:244616"/>
the head of the vale where Marheyo's habitation was situated <lb/>
effectually precluded all hope of escape in that quarter, even if I <lb/>
could have stolen away from the thousand eyes of the savages.</p>
<p>But these reflections now seldom obtruded upon me; I gave <lb/>
myself up to the passing hour, and if ever disagreeable thoughts <lb/>
arose in my mind, I drove them away. When I looked around <lb/>
the verdant recess in which I was buried, and gazed up to the <lb/>
summits of the lofty eminence that hemmed me in, I was well <lb/>
disposed to think that I was in the "Happy Valley," and that <lb/>
beyond those heights there was nought but a world of care and <lb/>
anxiety.</p>
<p>As I extended my wanderings in the valley and grew more <lb/>
familiar with the habits of its inmates, I was fain to confess that, <lb/>
despite the disadvantages of his condition, the Polynesian savage, <lb/>
surrounded by all the luxurious provisions of nature, enjoyed an <lb/>
infinitely happier, though certainly a less intellectual existence, <lb/>
than the self-complacent European.</p>
<p>The naked wretch who shivers beneath the bleak skies, and <lb/>
starves among the inhospitable wilds of Terra-del-Fuego, might <lb/>
indeed be made happier by civilization, for it would alleviate his <lb/>
physical wants. But the voluptuous Indian, with every desire <lb/>
supplied, whom Providence has bountifully provided with all the <lb/>
sources of pure and natural enjoyment, and from whom are <reg orig="re-|moved">removed</reg> <lb/>
so many of the ills and pains of life&mdash;what has he to <reg orig="de-|sire">desire</reg> <lb/>
at the hands of Civilization? She may "cultivate his <lb/>
mind,"&mdash;may "elevate his thoughts,"&mdash;these I believe are the <lb/>
established phrases&mdash;but will he be the happier? Let the once <lb/>
smiling and populous Hawiian islands, with their now diseased, <lb/>
starving, and dying natives, answer the question. The <reg orig="mission-|aries">missionaries</reg> <lb/>
may seek to disguise the matter as they will, but the facts <lb/>
are incontrovertible; and the devoutest Christian who visits that <lb/>
group with an unbiased mind, must go away mournfully asking <lb/>
&mdash;"Are these, alas! the fruits of twenty-five years of <reg orig="enlight-|ening">enlightening</reg>?"</p>
<p>In a primitive state of society, the enjoyments of life, though <lb/>
few and simple, are spread over a great extent, and are <reg orig="unal-|loyed">unalloyed</reg>; <lb/>
but Civilization, for every advantage she imparts, holds <lb/>
a hundred evils in reserve;&mdash;the heart burnings, the jealousies, <lb/>
the social rivalries, the family dissensions, and the thousand <reg orig="self-|inflicted">self-inflicted</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="138" entity="z000000574_0165" pid="uva-lib:244617"/>
discomforts of refined life, which make up in units the <lb/>
swelling aggregate of human misery, are unknown among these <lb/>
unsophisticated people.</p>
<p>But it will be urged that these shocking unprincipled wretches <lb/>
are cannibals. Very true; and a rather bad trait in their <reg orig="cha-|racter">character</reg> <lb/>
it must be allowed. But they are such only when they <lb/>
seek to gratify the passion of revenge upon their enemies; and I <lb/>
ask whether the mere eating of human flesh so very far exceeds <lb/>
in barbarity that custom which only a few years since was <reg orig="prac-|tised">practised</reg> <lb/>
in enlightened England:&mdash;a convicted traitor, perhaps a <lb/>
man found guilty of honesty, patriotism, and suchlike heinous <lb/>
crimes, had his head lopped off with a huge axe, his bowels <lb/>
dragged out and thrown into a fire; while his body, carved into <lb/>
four quarters, was with his head exposed upon pikes, and <reg orig="per-|mitted">permitted</reg> <lb/>
to rot and fester among the public haunts of men!</p>
<p>The fiend-like skill we display in the invention of all manner <lb/>
of death-dealing engines, the vindictiveness with which we carry <lb/>
on our wars, and the misery and desolation that follow in their <lb/>
train, are enough of themselves to distinguish the white civilized <lb/>
man as the most ferocious animal on the face of the earth.</p>
<p>His remorseless cruelty is seen in many of the institutions <lb/>
of our own favoured land. There is one in particular lately <lb/>
adopted in one of the States of the Union, which purports to <lb/>
have been dictated by the most merciful considerations. To <lb/>
destroy our malefactors piece-meal, drying up in their veins, <lb/>
drop by drop, the blood we are too chicken-hearted to shed by <lb/>
a single blow which would at once put a period to their <reg orig="suffer-|ings">sufferings</reg>, <lb/>
is deemed to be infinitely preferable to the old-fashioned <lb/>
punishment of gibbeting&mdash;much less annoying to the victim, <lb/>
and more in accordance with the refined spirit of the age; and <lb/>
yet how feeble is all language to describe the horrors we inflict <lb/>
upon these wretches, whom we mason up in the cells of our <lb/>
prisons, and condemn to perpetual solitude in the very heart <lb/>
of our population.</p>
<p>But it is needless to multiply the examples of civilized <reg orig="bar-|barity">barbarity</reg>; <lb/>
they far exceed in the amount of misery they cause the <lb/>
crimes which we regard with such abhorrence in our less <lb/>
enlightened fellow-creatures.</p>
<p>The term "Savage" is, I conceive, often misapplied, and <lb/>
<pb n="139" entity="z000000574_0166" pid="uva-lib:244618"/>
indeed when I consider the vices, cruelties, and enormities of <lb/>
every kind that spring up in the tainted atmosphere of a feverish <lb/>
civilization, I am inclined to think that so far as the relative <lb/>
wickedness of the parties is concerned, four or five Marquesan <lb/>
Islanders sent to the United States as Missionaries might be <lb/>
quite as useful as an equal number of Americans despatched to <lb/>
the Islands in a similar capacity.</p>
<p>I once heard it given as an instance of the frightful depravity <lb/>
of a certain tribe in the Pacific, that they had no word in their <lb/>
language to express the idea of virtue. The assertion was <lb/>
unfounded; but were it otherwise, it might be met by stating that <lb/>
their language is almost entirely destitute of terms to express <lb/>
the delightful ideas conveyed by our endless catalogue of civilized <lb/>
crimes.</p>
<p>In the altered frame of mind to which I have referred, every <lb/>
object that presented itself to my notice in the valley struck me <lb/>
in a new light, and the opportunities I now enjoyed of observing <lb/>
the manners of its inmates, tended to strengthen my favourable <lb/>
impressions. One peculiarity that fixed my admiration was the <lb/>
perpetual hilarity reigning through the whole extent of the vale. <lb/>
There seemed to be no cares, griefs, troubles, or vexations, in <lb/>
all Typee. The hours tripped along as gaily as the laughing <lb/>
couples down a country dance.</p>
<p>There were none of those thousand sources of irritation that <lb/>
the ingenuity of civilized man has created to mar his own felicity. <lb/>
There were no foreclosures of mortgages, no protested notes, no <lb/>
bills payable, no debts of honour in Typee; no unreasonable <lb/>
tailors and shoemakers, perversely bent on being paid; no duns <lb/>
of any description; no assault and battery attorneys, to foment <lb/>
discord, backing their clients up to a quarrel, and then knocking <lb/>
their heads together; no poor relations, everlastingly occupying <lb/>
the spare bed-chamber, and diminishing the elbow room at the <lb/>
family table; no destitute widows with their children starving <lb/>
on the cold charities of the world; no beggars; no debtors' <lb/>
prisons; no proud and hard-hearted nabobs in Typee; or to sum <lb/>
up all in one word&mdash;no Money! "That root of all evil" was <lb/>
not to be found in the valley.</p>
<p>In this secluded abode of happiness there were no cross old <lb/>
women, no cruel step-dames, no withered spinsters, no love-sick <lb/>
<pb n="140" entity="z000000574_0167" pid="uva-lib:244619"/>
maidens, no sour old bachelors, no inattentive husbands, no <reg orig="melan-|choly">melancholy</reg> <lb/>
young men, no blubbering youngsters, and no squalling <lb/>
brats. All was mirth, fun, and high good humour. Blue devils, <lb/>
hypochondria, and doleful dumps, went and hid themselves <lb/>
among the nooks and crannies of the rocks.</p>
<p>Here you would see a parcel of children frolicking together the <lb/>
live-long day, and no quarreling, no contention, among them. <lb/>
The same number in our own land could not have played <lb/>
together for the space of an hour without biting or scratching <lb/>
one another. There you might have seen a throng of young <lb/>
females, not filled with envyings of each other's charms, nor <lb/>
displaying the ridiculous affectations of gentility, nor yet moving <lb/>
in whalebone corsets, like so many automatons, but free, <reg orig="inarti-|ficially">inartificially</reg> <lb/>
happy, and unconstrained.</p>
<p>There were some spots in that sunny vale where they would <lb/>
frequently resort to decorate themselves with garlands of flowers. <lb/>
To have seen them reclining beneath the shadows of one of the <lb/>
beautiful groves; the ground about them strewn with freshly <lb/>
gathered buds and blossoms, employed in weaving chaplets and <lb/>
necklaces, one would have thought that all the train of Flora <lb/>
had gathered together to keep a festival in honour of their <lb/>
mistress.</p>
<p>With the young men there seemed almost always some matter <lb/>
of diversion or business on hand that afforded a constant variety <lb/>
of enjoyment. But whether fishing, or carving canoes, or <reg orig="polish-|ing">polishing</reg> <lb/>
their ornaments, never was there exhibited the least sign of <lb/>
strife or contention among them.</p>
<p>As for the warriors, they maintained a tranquil dignity of <lb/>
demeanor, journeying occasionally from house to house, where <lb/>
they were always sure to be received with the attention bestowed <lb/>
upon distinguished guests. The old men, of whom there were <lb/>
many in the vale, seldom stirred from their mats, where they <lb/>
would recline for hours and hours, smoking and talking to one <lb/>
another with all the garrulity of age.</p>
<p>But the continual happiness, which so far as I was able to <lb/>
judge appeared to prevail in the valley, sprung principally from <lb/>
that all-pervading sensation which Rousseau has told us he at one <lb/>
time experienced, the mere buoyant sense of a healthful physical <lb/>
existence. And indeed in this particular the Typees had ample <lb/>
<pb n="141" entity="z000000574_0168" pid="uva-lib:244620"/>
reason to felicitate themselves, for sickness was almost unknown. <lb/>
During the whole period of my stay I saw but one invalid among <lb/>
them; and on their smooth clear skins you observed no blemish <lb/>
or mark of disease.</p>
<p>The general repose, however, upon which I have just been <lb/>
descanting, was broken in upon about this time by an event <lb/>
which proved that the islanders were not entirely exempt from <lb/>
those occurrences which disturb the quiet of more civilized <lb/>
communities.</p>
<p>Having now been a considerable time in the valley, I began <lb/>
to feel surprised that the violent hostility subsisting between its <lb/>
inhabitants, and those of the adjoining bay of Happar, should <lb/>
never have manifested itself in any warlike encounter. Although <lb/>
the valiant Typees would often by gesticulations declare their <lb/>
undying hatred against their enemies, and the disgust they felt <lb/>
at their cannibal propensities; although they dilated upon the <lb/>
manifold injuries they had received at their hands, yet with a <lb/>
forbearance truly commendable, they appeared patiently to sit <lb/>
down under their grievances, and to refrain from making any <lb/>
reprisals. The Happars, entrenched behind their mountains, <lb/>
and never even showing themselves on their summits, did not <lb/>
appear to me to furnish adequate cause for that excess of <lb/>
animosity evinced towards them by the heroic tenants of our <lb/>
vale, and I was inclined to believe that the deeds of blood <lb/>
attributed to them had been greatly exaggerated.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as the clamours of war had not up to this <lb/>
period disturbed the serenity of the tribe, I began to distrust the <lb/>
truth of those reports which ascribed so fierce and belligerent a <lb/>
character to the Typee nation. Surely, thought I, all these <reg orig="ter-|rible">terrible</reg> <lb/>
stories I have heard about the inveteracy with which they <lb/>
carried on the feud, their deadly intensity of hatred, and the <reg orig="dia-|bolical">diabolical</reg> <lb/>
malice with which they glutted their revenge upon the <lb/>
inanimate forms of the slain, are nothing more than fables, and I <lb/>
must confess that I experienced something like a sense of regret <lb/>
at having my hideous anticipations thus disappointed. I felt in <lb/>
some sort like a 'prentice-boy who, going to the play in the <reg orig="ex-|pectation">expectation</reg> <lb/>
of being delighted with a cut-and-thrust tragedy, is <lb/>
almost moved to tears of disappointment at the exhibition of a <lb/>
genteel comedy.</p>
<pb n="142" entity="z000000574_0169" pid="uva-lib:244621"/>
<p>I could not avoid thinking that I had fallen in with a greatly <lb/>
traduced people, and I moralized not a little upon the <reg orig="disadvan-|tage">disadvantage</reg> <lb/>
of having a bad name, which in this instance had given a <lb/>
tribe of savages, who were as pacific as so many lambkins, the <lb/>
reputation of a confederacy of giant-killers.</p>
<p>But subsequent events proved that I had been a little too <lb/>
premature in coming to this conclusion. One day about noon, <lb/>
happening to be at the Ti, I had lain down on the mats <lb/>
with several of the chiefs, and had gradually sunk into a most <lb/>
luxurious siesta, when I was awakened by a tremendous outcry, <lb/>
and starting up beheld the natives seizing their spears and <reg orig="hurry-|ing">hurrying</reg> <lb/>
out, while the most puissant of the chiefs, grasping the six <lb/>
muskets which were ranged against the bamboos, followed after, <lb/>
and soon disappeared in the groves. These movements were <lb/>
accompanied by wild shouts, in which "Happar, Happar," <lb/>
greatly predominated. The islanders were now to be seen <lb/>
running past the Ti, and striking across the valley to the Happar <lb/>
side. Presently I heard the sharp report of a musket from the <lb/>
adjoining hills, and then a burst of voices in the same direction. <lb/>
At this the women, who had congregated in the groves, set up <lb/>
the most violent clamours, as they invariably do here as <reg orig="else-|where">elsewhere</reg> <lb/>
on every occasion of excitement and alarm, with a view <lb/>
of tranquillizing their own minds and disturbing other people. <lb/>
On this particular occasion they made such an outrageous noise, <lb/>
and continued it with such perseverance, that for awhile, had entire <lb/>
volleys of musketry been fired off in the neighbouring mountains, <lb/>
I should not have been able to have heard them.</p>
<p>When this female commotion had a little subsided I listened <lb/>
eagerly for further information. At last bang went another shot, <lb/>
and then a second volley of yells from the hills. Again all was <lb/>
quiet, and continued so for such a length of time that I began <lb/>
to think the contending armies had agreed upon a suspension of <lb/>
hostilities; when pop went a third gun, followed as before with <lb/>
a yell. After this, for nearly two hours nothing occurred worthy <lb/>
of comment, save some straggling shouts from the hill-side, <lb/>
sounding like the halloos of a parcel of truant boys who had lost <lb/>
themselves in the woods.</p>
<p>During this interval I had remained standing on the piazza of <lb/>
the "Ti," which directly fronted the Happar mountain, and with <lb/>
<pb n="143" entity="z000000574_0170" pid="uva-lib:244622"/>
no one near me but Kory-Kory and the old superannuated savages <lb/>
I have before described. These latter never stirred from their <lb/>
mats, and seemed altogether unconscious that anything unusual <lb/>
was going on.</p>
<p>As for Kory-Kory, he appeared to think that we were in the <lb/>
midst of great events, and sought most zealously to impress me <lb/>
with a due sense of their importance. Every sound that reached <lb/>
us conveyed some momentous item of intelligence to him. At <lb/>
such times, as if he were gifted with second sight, he would go <lb/>
through a variety of pantomimic illustrations, showing me the <lb/>
precise manner in which the redoubtable Typees were at that <lb/>
very moment chastising the insolence of the enemy. "Mehevi <lb/>
hanna pippee nuee Happar," he exclaimed every five minutes, <lb/>
giving me to understand that under that distinguished captain <lb/>
the warriors of his nation were performing prodigies of valour.</p>
<p>Having heard only four reports from the muskets, I was led <lb/>
to believe that they were worked by the islanders in the same <lb/>
manner as the Sultan Solyman's ponderous artillery at the siege <lb/>
of Byzantium, one of them taking an hour or two to load and <lb/>
train. At last, no sound whatever proceeding from the <reg orig="moun-|tains">mountains</reg>, <lb/>
I concluded that the contest had been determined one way <lb/>
or the other. Such appeared, indeed, to be the case, for in a <lb/>
little while a courier arrived at the "Ti," almost breathless with <lb/>
his exertions, and communicated the news of a great victory <lb/>
having been achieved by his countrymen: "Happar poo arva!&mdash; <lb/>
Happar poo arva!" (the cowards had fled). Kory-Kory was in <lb/>
ecstacies, and commenced a vehement harangue, which, so far as <lb/>
I understood it, implied that the result exactly agreed with his <lb/>
expectations, and which, moreover, was intended to convince me <lb/>
that it would be a perfectly useless undertaking, even for an army <lb/>
of fire-eaters, to offer battle to the irresistible heroes of our valley. <lb/>
In all this I of course acquiesced, and looked forward with no <lb/>
little interest to the return of the conquerors, whose victory I <lb/>
feared might not have been purchased without cost to <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg>.</p>
<p>But here I was again mistaken; for Mehevi, in conducting <lb/>
his warlike operations, rather inclined to the Fabian than to the <lb/>
Bonapartean tactics, husbanding his resources and exposing his <lb/>
troops to no unnecessary hazards. The total loss of the victors <lb/>
<pb n="144" entity="z000000574_0171" pid="uva-lib:244623"/>
in this obstinately contested affair was, in killed, wounded, and <lb/>
missing&mdash;one forefinger and part of a thumb-nail (which the late <lb/>
proprietor brought along with him in his hand), a severely <reg orig="con-|tused">contused</reg> <lb/>
arm, and a considerable effusion of blood flowing from the <lb/>
thigh of a chief, who had received an ugly thrust from a Happar <lb/>
spear. What the enemy had suffered I could not discover, but <lb/>
I presume they had succeeded in taking off with them the bodies <lb/>
of their slain.</p>
<p>Such was the issue of the battle, as far as its results came <lb/>
under my observation; and as it appeared to be considered an <lb/>
event of prodigious importance, I reasonably concluded that the <lb/>
wars of the natives were marked by no very sanguinary traits. <lb/>
I afterwards learned how the skirmish had originated. A <reg orig="num-|ber">number</reg> <lb/>
of the Happars had been discovered prowling for no good <lb/>
purpose on the Typee side of the mountain; the alarm was <lb/>
sounded, and the invaders, after a protracted resistance, had been <lb/>
chased over the frontier. But why had not the intrepid Mehevi <lb/>
carried the war into Happar? Why had he not made a descent <lb/>
into the hostile vale, and brought away some trophy of his <lb/>
victory&mdash;some materials for the cannibal entertainment which I <lb/>
had heard usually terminated every engagement? After all, I <lb/>
was much inclined to believe that such shocking festivals must <lb/>
occur very rarely among the islanders, if, indeed, they ever take <lb/>
place.</p>
<p>For two or three days the late event was the theme of general <lb/>
comment; after which the excitement gradually wore away, and <lb/>
the valley resumed its accustomed tranquillity.</p>

</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Returning</hi> health and peace of mind gave a new interest to <lb/>
everything around me. I sought to diversify my time by as many <lb/>
enjoyments as lay within reach. Bathing in company with <lb/>
troops of girls formed one of my chief amusements. We <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
enjoyed the recreation in the waters of a miniature lake, <lb/>
into which the central stream of the valley expanded. This <lb/>
lovely sheet of water was almost circular in figure, and about <lb/>
three hundred yards across. Its beauty was indescribable. All <lb/>
around its banks waved luxuriant masses of tropical foliage, <lb/>
soaring high above which were to be seen, here and there, the <lb/>
symmetrical shaft of the cocoa-nut tree, surmounted by its tuft <lb/>
of graceful branches, drooping in the air like so many waving <lb/>
ostrich plumes.</p>
<p>The ease and grace with which the maidens of the valley <reg orig="pro-|pelled">propelled</reg> <lb/>
themselves through the water, and their familiarity with <lb/>
the element, were truly astonishing. Sometimes they might be <lb/>
seen gliding along, just under the surface, without apparently <lb/>
moving hand or foot&mdash;then throwing themselves on their sides, <lb/>
they darted through the water, revealing glimpses of their forms, <lb/>
as, in the course of their rapid progress, they shot for an instant <lb/>
partly into the air&mdash;at one moment they dived deep down into <lb/>
the water and the next they rose bounding to the surface.</p>
<p>I remember upon one occasion plunging in among a parcel <lb/>
of these river-nymphs, and counting vainly upon my superior <lb/>
strength, sought to drag some of them under the water, but I <lb/>
quickly repented my temerity. The amphibious young creatures <lb/>
<pb n="146" entity="z000000574_0173" pid="uva-lib:244625"/>
swarmed about me like a shoal of dolphins, and seizing hold of <lb/>
my devoted limbs, tumbled me about and ducked me under the <lb/>
surface, until from the strange noises which rang in my ears, <lb/>
and the supernatural visions dancing before my eyes, I thought I <lb/>
was in the land of spirits. I stood indeed as little chance among <lb/>
them as a cumbrous whale attacked on all sides by a legion of <lb/>
sword-fish. When at length they relinquished their hold of me, <lb/>
they swam away in every direction, laughing at my clumsy <reg orig="en-|deavours">endeavours</reg> <lb/>
to reach them.</p>
<p>There was no boat on the lake; but at my solicitation and <lb/>
for my special use, some of the young men attached to Marheyo's <lb/>
household, under the direction of the indefatigable Kory-Kory, <lb/>
brought up a light and tastefully-carved canoe from the sea. It <lb/>
was launched upon the sheet of water, and floated there as <reg orig="grace-|fully">gracefully</reg> <lb/>
as a swan. But, melancholy to relate, it produced an effect <lb/>
I had not anticipated. The sweet nymphs, who had sported <lb/>
with me before in the lake, now all fled its vicinity. The <reg orig="pro-|hibited">prohibited</reg> <lb/>
craft, guarded by the edicts of the "taboo," extended the <lb/>
prohibition to the waters in which it lay.</p>
<p>For a few days, Kory-Kory, with one or two other youths, <lb/>
accompanied me in my excursions to the lake, and while I <reg orig="pad-|dled">paddled</reg> <lb/>
about in my light canoe, would swim after me shouting <lb/>
and gambolling in pursuit. But I was ever partial to what is <lb/>
termed in the `Young Men's Own Book' &mdash; "the society of <lb/>
virtuous and intelligent young ladies;" and in the absence of the <lb/>
mermaids, the amusement became dull and insipid. One morning <lb/>
I expressed to my faithful servitor my desire for the return of <lb/>
the nymphs. The honest fellow looked at me bewildered for a <lb/>
moment, and then shook his head solemnly, and murmured <lb/>
"<hi rend="italic">taboo! taboo!</hi>" giving me to understand that unless the canoe <lb/>
was removed, I could not expect to have the young ladies back <lb/>
again. But to this procedure I was averse; I not only wanted <lb/>
the canoe to stay where it was, but I wanted the beauteous <reg orig="Fay-|away">Fayaway</reg> <lb/>
to get into it, and paddle with me about the lake. This <lb/>
latter proposition completely horrified Kory-Kory's notions of <lb/>
propriety. He inveighed against it, as something too monstrous <lb/>
to be thought of. It not only shocked their established notions <lb/>
of propriety, but was at variance with all their religious <reg orig="ordi-|nances">ordinances</reg>.</p>
<pb n="147" entity="z000000574_0174" pid="uva-lib:244626"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">L 2</fw></pb>
<p>However, although the "taboo" was a ticklish thing to meddle <lb/>
with, I determined to test its capabilities of resisting an attack. <lb/>
I consulted the chief Mehevi, who endeavoured to dissuade me <lb/>
from my object: but I was not to be repulsed; and accordingly <lb/>
increased the warmth of my solicitations. At last he entered <lb/>
into a long, and I have no doubt a very learned and eloquent <lb/>
exposition of the history and nature of the "taboo" as affecting <lb/>
this particular case; employing a variety of most extraordinary <lb/>
words, which, from their amazing length and sonorousness, I have <lb/>
every reason to believe were of a theological nature. But all <lb/>
that he said failed to convince me: partly, perhaps, because I <lb/>
could not comprehend a word that he uttered; but chiefly, that <lb/>
for the life of me I could not understand why a woman should <lb/>
not have as much right to enter a canoe as a man. At last he <lb/>
became a little more rational, and intimated that, out of the <lb/>
abundant love he bore me, he would consult with the priests and <lb/>
see what could be done.</p>
<p>How it was that the priesthood of Typee satisfied the affair <lb/>
with their consciences, I know not; but so it was, and Fayaway's <lb/>
dispensation from this portion of the taboo was at length <reg orig="pro-|cured">procured</reg>. <lb/>
Such an event I believe never before had occurred in the <lb/>
valley; but it was high time the islanders should be taught a <lb/>
little gallantry, and I trust that the example I set them may <reg orig="pro-|duce">produce</reg> <lb/>
beneficial effects. Ridiculous, indeed, that the lovely <lb/>
creatures should be obliged to paddle about in the water, like so <lb/>
many ducks, while a parcel of great strapping fellows skimmed <lb/>
over its surface in their canoes.</p>
<p>The first day after Fayaway's emancipation I had a delightful <lb/>
little party on the lake&mdash;the damsel, Kory-Kory, and myself. <lb/>
My zealous body-servant brought from the house a calabash of <lb/>
poe-poe, half a dozen young cocoa-nuts&mdash;stripped of their husks&mdash; <lb/>
three pipes, as many yams, and me on his back a part of the way. <lb/>
Something of a load; but Kory-Kory was a very strong man for <lb/>
his size, and by no means brittle in the spine. We had a very <lb/>
pleasant day; my trusty valet plied the paddle and swept us <lb/>
gently along the margin of the water, beneath the shades of the <lb/>
overhanging thickets. Fayaway and I reclined in the stern of <lb/>
the canoe, on the very best terms possible with one another; the <lb/>
gentle nymph occasionally placing her pipe to her lip, and <lb/>
<pb n="148" entity="z000000574_0175" pid="uva-lib:244627"/>
exhaling the mild fumes of the tobacco, to which her rosy breath <lb/>
added a fresh perfume. Strange as it may seem, there is nothing <lb/>
in which a young and beautiful female appears to more <reg orig="advan-|tage">advantage</reg> <lb/>
than in the act of smoking. How captivating is a Peruvian <lb/>
lady, swinging in her gaily-woven hammock of grass, extended <lb/>
between two orange trees, and inhaling the fragrance of a choice <lb/>
cigarro! But Fayaway, holding in her delicately formed olive <lb/>
hand the long yellow reed of her pipe, with its quaintly carved <lb/>
bowl, and every few moments languishingly giving forth light <lb/>
wreaths of vapour from her mouth and nostrils, looked still more <lb/>
engaging.</p>
<p>We floated about thus for several hours, when I looked up to <lb/>
the warm, glowing, tropical sky, and then down into the <reg orig="trans-|parent">transparent</reg> <lb/>
depths below; and when my eye, wandering from the <lb/>
bewitching scenery around, fell upon the grotesquely-tattooed <lb/>
form of Kory-Kory, and finally encountered the pensive gaze of <lb/>
Fayaway, I thought I had been transported to some fairy region, <lb/>
so unreal did everything appear.</p>
<p>This lovely piece of water was the coolest spot in all the <lb/>
valley, and I now made it a place of continual resort during the <lb/>
hottest period of the day. One side of it lay near the <reg orig="termi-|nation">termination</reg> <lb/>
of a long gradually expanding gorge, which mounted to <lb/>
the heights that environed the vale. The strong trade wind, <lb/>
met in its course by these elevations, circled and eddied about <lb/>
their summits, and was sometimes driven down the steep ravine <lb/>
and swept across the valley, ruffling in its passage the otherwise <lb/>
tranquil surface of the lake.</p>
<p>One day, after we had been paddling about for some time, I <lb/>
disembarked Kory-Kory, and paddled the canoe to the windward <lb/>
side of the lake. As I turned the canoe, Fayaway, who was <lb/>
with me, seemed all at once to be struck with some happy idea. <lb/>
With a wild exclamation of delight, she disengaged from her <lb/>
person the ample robe of tappa which was knotted over her <lb/>
shoulder (for the purpose of shielding her from the sun), and <lb/>
spreading it out like a sail, stood erect with upraised arms in the <lb/>
head of the canoe. We American sailors pride ourselves upon <lb/>
our straight clean spars, but a prettier little mast than Fayaway <lb/>
made was never shipped a-board of any craft.</p>
<p>In a moment the tappa was distended by the breeze&mdash;the long <lb/>
<pb n="149" entity="z000000574_0176" pid="uva-lib:244628"/>
brown tresses of Fayaway streamed in the air&mdash;and the canoe <lb/>
glided rapidly through the water, and shot towards the shore. <lb/>
Seated in the stern, I directed its course with my paddle until it <lb/>
dashed up the soft sloping bank, and Fayaway, with a light <lb/>
spring, alighted on the ground; whilst Kory-Kory, who had <lb/>
watched our man&oelig;uvres with admiration, now clapped his hands <lb/>
in transport, and shouted like a madman. Many a time <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
was this feat repeated.</p>
<p>If the reader have not observed ere this that I was the <lb/>
declared admirer of Miss Fayaway, all I can say is that he is <lb/>
little conversant with affairs of the heart, and I certainly <lb/>
shall not trouble myself to enlighten him any farther. Out of <lb/>
the calico I had brought from the ship I made a dress for this <lb/>
lovely girl. In it she looked, I must confess, something like an <lb/>
opera dancer. The drapery of the latter damsel generally <reg orig="com-|mences">commences</reg> <lb/>
a little above the elbows, but my island beauty's began <lb/>
at the waist, and terminated sufficiently far above the ground to <lb/>
reveal the most bewitching ankle in the universe.</p>
<p>The day that Fayaway first wore this robe was rendered <lb/>
memorable by a new acquaintance being introduced to me. In <lb/>
the afternoon I was lying in the house, when I heard a great <lb/>
uproar outside; but being by this time pretty well accustomed to <lb/>
the wild halloos which were almost continually ringing through <lb/>
the valley, I paid little attention to it, until old Marheyo, under <lb/>
the influence of some strange excitement, rushed into my <reg orig="pre-|sence">presence</reg> <lb/>
and communicated the astounding tidings, "Marnoo <lb/>
pemi!" which being interpreted, implied that an individual by <lb/>
the name of Marnoo was approaching. My worthy old friend <lb/>
evidently expected that this intelligence would produce a great <lb/>
effect upon me, and for a time he stood earnestly regarding me, <lb/>
as if curious to see how I should conduct myself, but as I <lb/>
remained perfectly unmoved, the old gentleman darted out of the <lb/>
house again, in as great a hurry as he had entered it.</p>
<p>"Marnoo, Marnoo," cogitated I, "I have never heard that name <lb/>
before. Some distinguished character, I presume, from the <reg orig="pro-|digious">prodigious</reg> <lb/>
riot the natives are making;" the tumultuous noise <lb/>
drawing nearer and nearer every moment, while "Marnoo!&mdash; <lb/>
Marnoo!" was shouted by every tongue.</p>
<p>I made up my mind that some savage warrior of consequence, <lb/>
<pb n="150" entity="z000000574_0177" pid="uva-lib:244629"/>
who had not yet enjoyed the honour of an audience, was desirous <lb/>
of paying his respects on the present occasion. So vain had I <lb/>
become by the lavish attention to which I had been accustomed, <lb/>
that I felt half inclined, as a punishment for such neglect, to <lb/>
give this Marnoo a cold reception, when the excited throng <lb/>
came within view, convoying one of the most striking specimens <lb/>
of humanity that I ever beheld.</p>
<p>The stranger could not have been more than twenty-five years <lb/>
of age, and was a little above the ordinary height; had he been <lb/>
a single hair's breadth taller, the matchless symmetry of his form <lb/>
would have been destroyed. His unclad limbs were beautifully <lb/>
formed; whilst the elegant outline of his figure, together with <lb/>
his beardless cheeks, might have entitled him to the distinction of <lb/>
standing for the statue of the Polynesian Apollo; and indeed the <lb/>
oval of his countenance and the regularity of every feature <lb/>
reminded me of an antique bust. But the marble repose of art <lb/>
was supplied by a warmth and liveliness of expression only to be <lb/>
seen in the South Sea Islander under the most favourable <reg orig="deve-|lopments">developments</reg> <lb/>
of nature. The hair of Marnoo was a rich curling <lb/>
brown, and twined about his temples and neck in little close <lb/>
curling ringlets, which danced up and down continually when he <lb/>
was animated in conversation. His cheek was of a feminine <lb/>
softness, and his face was free from the least blemish of tattooing, <lb/>
although the rest of his body was drawn all over with fanciful <lb/>
figures, which &mdash; unlike the unconnected sketching usual among <lb/>
these natives &mdash; appeared to have been executed in conformity with <lb/>
some general design.</p>
<p>The tattooing on his back in particular attracted my attention. <lb/>
The artist employed must indeed have excelled in his profession. <lb/>
Traced along the course of the spine was accurately delineated <lb/>
the slender, tapering, and diamond-checkered shaft of the <reg orig="beau-|tiful">beautiful</reg> <lb/>
"artu" tree. Branching from the stem on either side, and <lb/>
disposed alternately, were the graceful branches drooping with <lb/>
leaves all correctly drawn, and elaborately finished. Indeed, this <lb/>
piece of tattooing was the best specimen of the Fine Arts I had <lb/>
yet seen in Typee. A rear view of the stranger might have <reg orig="sug-|gested">suggested</reg> <lb/>
the idea of a spreading vine tacked against a garden wall. <lb/>
Upon his breast, arms, and legs, were exhibited an infinite variety <lb/>
of figures; every one of which, however, appeared to have <reg orig="refer-|ence">reference</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="151" entity="z000000574_0178" pid="uva-lib:244630"/>
to the general effect sought to be produced. The tattooing <lb/>
I have described was of the brightest blue, and when contrasted <lb/>
with the light olive colour of the skin, produced an unique and <lb/>
even elegant effect. A slight girdle of white tappa, scarcely <lb/>
two inches in width, but hanging before and behind in spreading <lb/>
tassels, composed the entire costume of the stranger.</p>
<p>He advanced surrounded by the islanders, carrying under one <lb/>
arm a small roll of the native cloth, and grasping in his other <lb/>
hand a long and richly decorated spear. His manner was that of <lb/>
a traveller conscious that he is approaching a comfortable stage <lb/>
in his journey. Every moment he turned good-humouredly to <lb/>
the throng around him, and gave some dashing sort of reply to <lb/>
their incessant queries, which appeared to convulse them with <lb/>
uncontrollable mirth.</p>
<p>Struck by his demeanor, and the peculiarity of his appearance, <lb/>
so unlike that of the shaven-crowned and face-tattooed natives in <lb/>
general, I involuntarily rose as he entered the house, and <reg orig="prof-|ferred">profferred</reg> <lb/>
him a seat on the mats beside me. But without deigning <lb/>
to notice the civility, or even the more incontrovertible fact of <lb/>
my existence, the stranger passed on, utterly regardless of me, <lb/>
and flung himself upon the further end of the long couch that <lb/>
traversed the sole apartment of Marheyo's habitation.</p>
<p>Had the belle of the season, in the pride of her beauty and <lb/>
power, been cut in a place of public resort by some supercilious <lb/>
exquisite, she could not have felt greater indignation than I did <lb/>
at this unexpected slight.</p>
<p>I was thrown into utter astonishment. The conduct of the <lb/>
savages had prepared me to anticipate from every new comer the <lb/>
same extravagant expressions of curiosity and regard. The <reg orig="sin-|gularity">singularity</reg> <lb/>
of his conduct, however, only roused my desire to <lb/>
discover who this remarkable personage might be, who now <lb/>
engrossed the attention of every one.</p>
<p>Tinor placed before him a calabash of poee-poee, from which <lb/>
the stranger regaled himself, alternating every mouthful with <lb/>
some rapid exclamation which was eagerly caught up and echoed <lb/>
by the crowd that completely filled the house. When I observed <lb/>
the striking devotion of the natives to him, and their temporary <lb/>
withdrawal of all attention from myself, I felt not a little piqued. <lb/>
The glory of Tommo is departed, thought I, and the sooner he <lb/>
<pb n="152" entity="z000000574_0179" pid="uva-lib:244631"/>
removes from the valley the better. These were my feelings at <lb/>
the moment, and they were prompted by that glorious principle <lb/>
inherent in all heroic natures&mdash;the strong-rooted determination to <lb/>
have the biggest share of the pudding or go without any of it.</p>
<p>Marnoo, this all-attractive personage, having satisfied his <lb/>
hunger, and inhaled a few whiffs from a pipe which was handed <lb/>
to him, launched out into an harangue which completely <reg orig="en-|chained">enchained</reg> <lb/>
the attention of his auditors.</p>
<p>Little as I understood of the language, yet from his animated <lb/>
gestures and the varying expression of his features&mdash;reflected as <lb/>
from so many mirrors in the countenances around him, I could <lb/>
easily discover the nature of those passions which he sought to <lb/>
arouse. From the frequent recurrence of the words "<reg orig="Nuku-|heva">Nukuheva</reg>" <lb/>
and "Frannee" (French), and some others with the <lb/>
meaning of which I was acquainted, he appeared to be rehearsing <lb/>
to his auditors events which had recently occurred in the <reg orig="neigh-|bouring">neighbouring</reg> <lb/>
bays. But how he had gained the knowledge of these <lb/>
matters I could not understand, unless it were that he had just <lb/>
come from Nukuheva&mdash;a supposition which his travel-stained <lb/>
appearance not a little supported. But, if a native of that region, <lb/>
I could not account for his friendly reception at the hands of the <lb/>
Typees.</p>
<p>Never, certainly, had I beheld so powerful an exhibition of <lb/>
natural eloquence as Marnoo displayed during the course of his <lb/>
oration. The grace of the attitudes into which he threw his <lb/>
flexible figure, the striking gestures of his naked arms, and above <lb/>
all, the fire which shot from his brilliant eyes, imparted an effect <lb/>
to the continually changing accents of his voice, of which the <lb/>
most accomplished orator might have been proud. At one <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg> <lb/>
reclining sideways upon the mat, and leaning calmly upon <lb/>
his bended arm, he related circumstantially the aggressions of the <lb/>
French&mdash;their hostile visits to the surrounding bays, enumerating <lb/>
each one in succession&mdash;Happar, Puerka, Nukuheva, Tior,&mdash;and <lb/>
then starting to his feet and precipitating himself forward with <lb/>
clenched hands and a countenance distorted with passion, he <lb/>
poured out a tide of invectives. Falling back into an attitude of <lb/>
lofty command, he exhorted the Typees to resist these <reg orig="encroach-|ments">encroachments</reg>; <lb/>
reminding them, with a fierce glance of exultation, that <lb/>
as yet the terror of their name had preserved them from attack, <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="z000000574_0180" pid="uva-lib:244632"/>
and with a scornful sneer he sketched in ironical terms the <reg orig="won-|drous">wondrous</reg> <lb/>
intrepidity of the French, who, with five war-canoes and <lb/>
hundreds of men, had not dared to assail the naked warriors of <lb/>
their valley.</p>
<p>The effect he produced upon his audience was electric; one <lb/>
and all they stood regarding him with sparkling eyes and <reg orig="trem-|bling">trembling</reg> <lb/>
limbs, as though they were listening to the inspired voice of <lb/>
a prophet.</p>
<p>But it soon appeared that Marnoo's powers were as versatile as <lb/>
they were extraordinary. As soon as he had finished this <reg orig="vehe-|ment">vehement</reg> <lb/>
harangue, he threw himself again upon the mats, and, <lb/>
singling out individuals in the crowd, addressed them by name, <lb/>
in a sort of bantering style, the humour of which, though nearly <lb/>
hidden from me, filled the whole assembly with uproarious <lb/>
delight.</p>
<p>He had a word for everybody; and, turning rapidly from one <lb/>
to another, gave utterance to some hasty witticism, which was <lb/>
sure to be followed by peals of laughter. To the females, as <lb/>
well as to the men, he addressed his discourse. Heaven only <lb/>
knows what he said to them, but he caused smiles and blushes to <lb/>
mantle their ingenuous faces. I am, indeed, very much inclined <lb/>
to believe that Marnoo, with his handsome person and <reg orig="captivat-|ing">captivating</reg> <lb/>
manners, was a sad deceiver among the simple maidens of <lb/>
the island.</p>
<p>During all this time he had never, for one moment, deigned to <lb/>
regard me. He appeared, indeed, to be altogether unconscious <lb/>
of my presence. I was utterly at a loss how to account for this <lb/>
extraordinary conduct. I easily perceived that he was a man of <lb/>
no little consequence among the islanders; that he possessed <reg orig="un-|common">uncommon</reg> <lb/>
talents; and was gifted with a higher degree of <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
than the inmates of the valley. For these reasons, I <lb/>
therefore greatly feared lest having, from some cause or other, <lb/>
unfriendly feelings toward me, he might exert his powerful <reg orig="in-|fluence">influence</reg> <lb/>
to do me mischief.</p>
<p>It seemed evident that he was not a permanent resident of the <lb/>
vale, and yet, whence could he have come? On all sides the <lb/>
Typees were girt in by hostile tribes, and how could he <reg orig="pos-|sibly">possibly</reg>, <lb/>
if belonging to any of these, be received with so much <lb/>
cordiality?</p>
<pb n="154" entity="z000000574_0181" pid="uva-lib:244633"/>
<p>The personal appearance of the enigmatical stranger suggested <lb/>
additional perplexities. The face, free from tattooing, and the <lb/>
unshaven crown, were peculiarities I had never before remarked <lb/>
in any part of the island, and I had always heard that the <reg orig="con-|trary">contrary</reg> <lb/>
were considered the indispensable distinctions of a Marquesan <lb/>
warrior. Altogether the matter was perfectly incomprehensible <lb/>
to me, and I awaited its solution with no small degree of anxiety.</p>
<p>At length, from certain indications, I suspected that he was <lb/>
making me the subject of his remarks, although he appeared <lb/>
cautiously to avoid either pronouncing my name, or looking in <lb/>
the direction where I lay. All at once he rose from the mats <lb/>
where he had been reclining, and, still conversing, moved towards <lb/>
me, his eye purposely evading mine, and seated himself within <lb/>
less than a yard of me. I had hardly recovered from my <reg orig="sur-|prise">surprise</reg>, <lb/>
when he suddenly turned round, and, with a most <reg orig="benig-|nant">benignant</reg> <lb/>
countenance, extended his right hand gracefully towards <lb/>
me. Of course I accepted the courteous challenge, and, as soon <lb/>
as our palms met, he bent towards me, and murmured in musical <lb/>
accents,&mdash;"How you do?" "How long you been in this bay?" <lb/>
"You like this bay?"</p>
<p>Had I been pierced simultaneously by three Happar spears, I <lb/>
could not have started more than I did at hearing these simple <lb/>
questions! For a moment I was overwhelmed with <reg orig="astonish-|ment">astonishment</reg>, <lb/>
and then answered something I know not what; but as <lb/>
soon as I regained my self-possession, the thought darted through <lb/>
my mind that from this individual I might obtain that <reg orig="informa-|tion">information</reg> <lb/>
regarding Toby which I suspected the natives had purposely <lb/>
withheld from me. Accordingly I questioned him concerning <lb/>
the disappearance of my companion, but he denied all knowledge <lb/>
of the matter. I then enquired from whence he had come? <lb/>
He replied, from Nukuheva. When I expressed my surprise, he <lb/>
looked at me for a moment, as if enjoying my perplexity, and <lb/>
then, with his strange vivacity, exclaimed,&mdash;"Ah! me taboo,&mdash; <lb/>
me go Nukuheva,&mdash;me go Tior,&mdash;me go Typee,&mdash;me go every <lb/>
where,&mdash;nobody harm me,&mdash;me taboo."</p>
<p>This explanation would have been altogether unintelligible to <lb/>
me, had it not recalled to my mind something I had previously <lb/>
heard concerning a singular custom among these islanders. <lb/>
Though the country is possessed by various tribes, whose mutual <lb/>
<pb n="155" entity="z000000574_0182" pid="uva-lib:244634"/>
hostilities almost wholly preclude any intercourse between them; <lb/>
yet there are instances where a person having ratified friendly <lb/>
relations with some individual belonging to the valley, whose <reg orig="in-|mates">inmates</reg> <lb/>
are at war with his own, may, under particular restrictions, <lb/>
venture with impunity into the country of his friend, where, <lb/>
under other circumstances, he would have been treated as an <lb/>
enemy. In this light are personal friendships regarded among <lb/>
them, and the individual so protected is said to be "taboo," and <lb/>
his person, to a certain extent, is held as sacred. Thus the <lb/>
stranger informed me he had access to all the valleys in the island.</p>
<p>Curious to know how he had acquired his knowledge of <lb/>
English, I questioned him on the subject. At first, for some <lb/>
reason or other, he evaded the enquiry, but afterwards told me <lb/>
that, when a boy, he had been carried to sea by the captain of a <lb/>
trading vessel, with whom he had staid three years, living part <lb/>
of the time with him at Sydney, in Australia, and that, at <lb/>
a subsequent visit to the island, the captain had, at his own <reg orig="re-|quest">request</reg>, <lb/>
permitted him to remain among his countrymen. The <lb/>
natural quickness of the savage had been wonderfully improved <lb/>
by his intercourse with the white men, and his partial knowledge <lb/>
of a foreign language gave him a great ascendancy over his less <lb/>
accomplished countrymen.</p>
<p>When I asked the now affable Marnoo why it was that he had <lb/>
not previously spoken to me, he eagerly enquired what I had <lb/>
been led to think of him from his conduct in that respect. I <lb/>
replied, that I had supposed him to be some great chief or <reg orig="war-|rior">warrior</reg>, <lb/>
who had seen plenty of white men before, and did not think <lb/>
it worth while to notice a poor sailor. At this declaration of the <lb/>
exalted opinion I had formed of him, he appeared vastly <reg orig="grati-|fied">gratified</reg>, <lb/>
and gave me to understand that he had purposely behaved <lb/>
in that manner, in order to increase my astonishment, as soon as <lb/>
he should see proper to address me.</p>
<p>Marnoo now sought to learn my version of the story as to how <lb/>
I came to be an inmate of the Typee valley. When I related <lb/>
to him the circumstances under which Toby and I had entered <lb/>
it, he listened with evident interest; but as soon as I alluded to <lb/>
the absence, yet unaccounted for, of my comrade, he endeavoured <lb/>
to change the subject, as if it were something he desired not to <lb/>
agitate. It seemed, indeed, as if everything connected with <lb/>
<pb n="156" entity="z000000574_0183" pid="uva-lib:244635"/>
Toby was destined to beget distrust and anxiety in my bosom. <lb/>
Notwithstanding Marnoo's denial of any knowledge of his fate, <lb/>
I could not avoid suspecting that he was deceiving me; and this <lb/>
suspicion revived those frightful apprehensions with regard to <lb/>
my own fate, which, for a short time past, had subsided in my <lb/>
breast.</p>
<p>Influenced by these feelings, I now felt a strong desire to <lb/>
avail myself of the stranger's protection, and under his safeguard <lb/>
to return to Nukuheva. But as soon as I hinted at this, he <reg orig="un-|hesitatingly">unhesitatingly</reg> <lb/>
pronounced it to be entirely impracticable; assuring <lb/>
me that the Typees would never consent to my leaving the valley. <lb/>
Although what he said merely confirmed the impression which I <lb/>
had before entertained, still it increased my anxiety to escape <lb/>
from a captivity, which, however endurable, nay, delightful it <lb/>
might be in some respects, involved in its issues a fate marked <lb/>
by the most frightful contingencies.</p>
<p>I could not conceal from my mind that Toby had been treated <lb/>
in the same friendly manner as I had been, and yet all their <lb/>
kindness had terminated in his mysterious disappearance. Might <lb/>
not the same fate await me?&mdash;a fate too dreadful to think of. <lb/>
Stimulated by these considerations, I urged anew my request to <lb/>
Marnoo; but he only set forth in stronger colours the <reg orig="impossi-|bility">impossibility</reg> <lb/>
of my escape, and repeated his previous declaration that <lb/>
the Typees would never be brought to consent to my departure.</p>
<p>When I endeavoured to learn from him the motives which <lb/>
prompted them to hold me a prisoner, Marnoo again assumed <lb/>
that mysterious tone which had tormented me with <reg orig="apprehen-|sions">apprehensions</reg> <lb/>
when I had questioned him with regard to the fate of <lb/>
my companion.</p>
<p>Thus repulsed, in a manner which only served, by arousing <lb/>
the most dreadful forebodings, to excite me to renewed attempts, <lb/>
I conjured him to intercede for me with the natives, and <reg orig="en-|deavour">endeavour</reg> <lb/>
to procure their consent to my leaving them. To this <lb/>
he appeared strongly averse; but, yielding at last to my <reg orig="impor-|tunities">importunities</reg>, <lb/>
he addressed several of the chiefs, who with the rest had <lb/>
been eyeing us intently during the whole of our conversation. <lb/>
His petition, however, was at once met with the most violent <lb/>
disapprobation, manifesting itself in angry glances and gestures, <lb/>
and a perfect torrent of passionate words, directed to both him <lb/>
<pb n="157" entity="z000000574_0184" pid="uva-lib:244636"/>
and myself. Marnoo, evidently repenting the step he had taken, <lb/>
earnestly deprecated the resentment of the crowd, and in a few <lb/>
moments succeeded in pacifying to some extent the clamours <lb/>
which had broken out as soon as his proposition had been <reg orig="under-|stood">understood</reg>.</p>
<p>With the most intense interest had I watched the reception <lb/>
his intercession might receive; and a bitter pang shot through <lb/>
my heart at the additional evidence, now furnished, of the <reg orig="un-|changeable">unchangeable</reg> <lb/>
determination of the islanders. Marnoo told me, <lb/>
with evident alarm in his countenance, that although admitted <lb/>
into the bay on a friendly footing with its inhabitants, he could <lb/>
not presume to meddle with their concerns, as such a procedure, <lb/>
if persisted in, would at once absolve the Typees from the <reg orig="re-|straints">restraints</reg> <lb/>
of the "Taboo," although so long as he refrained from <lb/>
any such conduct, it screened him effectually from the <reg orig="conse-|quences">consequences</reg> <lb/>
of the enmity they bore his tribe.</p>
<p>At this moment, Mehevi, who was present, angrily interrupted <lb/>
him; and the words which he uttered, in a commanding tone, <lb/>
evidently meant that he must at once cease talking to me, and <lb/>
withdraw to the other part of the house. Marnoo immediately <lb/>
started up, hurriedly enjoining me not to address him again, and, <lb/>
as I valued my safety, to refrain from all further allusion to the <lb/>
subject of my departure; and then, in compliance with the order <lb/>
of the determined chief, but not before it had again been angrily <lb/>
repeated, he withdrew to a distance.</p>
<p>I now perceived, with no small degree of apprehension, the <lb/>
same savage expression in the countenance of the natives which <lb/>
had startled me during the scene at the Ti. They glanced their <lb/>
eyes suspiciously from Marnoo to me, as if distrusting the nature <lb/>
of an intercourse carried on, as it was, in a language they could <lb/>
not understand, and they seemed to harbour the belief that already <lb/>
we had concerted measures calculated to elude their vigilance.</p>
<p>The lively countenances of these people are wonderfully <reg orig="indi-|cative">indicative</reg> <lb/>
of the emotions of the soul, and the imperfections of their <lb/>
oral language are more than compensated for by the nervous <lb/>
eloquence of their looks and gestures. I could plainly trace, in <lb/>
every varying expression of their faces, all those passions which <lb/>
had been thus unexpectedly aroused in their bosoms.</p>
<p>It required no reflection to convince me, from what was going <lb/>
<pb n="158" entity="z000000574_0185" pid="uva-lib:244637"/>
on, that the injunction of Marnoo was not to be rashly slighted; <lb/>
and accordingly, great as was the effort to suppress my feelings, <lb/>
I accosted Mehevi in a good-humoured tone, with a view of <reg orig="dis-|sipating">dissipating</reg> <lb/>
any ill impression he might have received. But the <lb/>
ireful, angry chief was not so easily mollified. He rejected my <lb/>
advances with that peculiarly stern expression I have before <lb/>
described, and took care by the whole of his behaviour towards <lb/>
me to show the displeasure and resentment which he felt.</p>
<p>Marnoo, at the other extremity of the house, apparently <reg orig="de-|sirous">desirous</reg> <lb/>
of making a diversion in my favour, exerted himself to <lb/>
amuse with his pleasantries the crowd about him; but his lively <lb/>
attempts were not so successful as they had previously been, and, <lb/>
foiled in his efforts, he rose gravely to depart. No one expressed <lb/>
any regret at this movement, so seizing his roll of tappa, and <lb/>
grasping his spear, he advanced to the front of the pi-pi, and <lb/>
waving his hand in adieu to the now silent throng, cast upon me <lb/>
a glance of mingled pity and reproach, and flung himself into <lb/>
the path which led from the house. I watched his receding <lb/>
figure until it was lost in the obscurity of the grove, and then <lb/>
gave myself up to the most desponding reflections.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> knowledge I had now obtained as to the intention of the <lb/>
savages deeply affected me.</p>
<p>Marnoo, I perceived, was a man who, by reason of his superior <lb/>
acquirements, and the knowledge he possessed of the events which <lb/>
were taking place in the different bays of the island, was held in <lb/>
no little estimation by the inhabitants of the valley. He had <lb/>
been received with the most cordial welcome and respect. The <lb/>
natives had hung upon the accents of his voice, and had <reg orig="mani-|fested">manifested</reg> <lb/>
the highest gratification at being individually noticed by <lb/>
him. And yet, despite all this, a few words urged in my behalf, <lb/>
with the intent of obtaining my release from captivity, had <lb/>
sufficed not only to banish all harmony and good-will; but, if I <lb/>
could believe what he told me, had gone nigh to endanger his <lb/>
own personal safety.</p>
<p>How strongly rooted, then, must be the determination of the <lb/>
Typees with regard to me, and how suddenly could they display <lb/>
the strangest passions! The mere suggestion of my departure <lb/>
had estranged from me, for the time at least, Mehevi, who was <lb/>
the most influential of all the chiefs, and who had previously <reg orig="exhi-|bited">exhibited</reg> <lb/>
so many instances of his friendly sentiments. The rest of <lb/>
the natives had likewise evinced their strong repugnance to my <lb/>
wishes, and even Kory-Kory himself seemed to share in the <lb/>
general disapprobation bestowed upon me.</p>
<p>In vain I racked my invention to find out some motive for the <lb/>
strange desire these people manifested to retain me among them; <lb/>
but I could discover none.</p>
<p>But however this might be, the scene which had just occurred <lb/>
admonished me of the danger of trifling with the wayward and <lb/>
passionate spirits against whom it was vain to struggle, and <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="z000000574_0187" pid="uva-lib:244639"/>
might even be fatal to do so. My only hope was to induce the <lb/>
natives to believe that I was reconciled to my detention in the <lb/>
valley, and by assuming a tranquil and cheerful demeanour, to <lb/>
allay the suspicions which I had so unfortunately aroused. Their <lb/>
confidence revived, they might in a short time remit in some <lb/>
degree their watchfulness over my movements, and I should then <lb/>
be the better enabled to avail myself of any opportunity which <lb/>
presented itself for escape. I determined, therefore, to make the <lb/>
best of a bad bargain, and to bear up manfully against whatever <lb/>
might betide. In this endeavour I succeeded beyond my own <lb/>
expectations. At the period of Marnoo's visit, I had been in <lb/>
the valley, as nearly as I could conjecture, some two months. <lb/>
Although not completely recovered from my strange illness <lb/>
which still lingered about me, I was free from pain and able to <lb/>
take exercise. In short, I had every reason to anticipate a <reg orig="per-|fect">perfect</reg> <lb/>
recovery. Freed from apprehensions on this point, and <lb/>
resolved to regard the future without flinching, I flung myself <lb/>
anew into all the social pleasures of the valley, and sought to <lb/>
bury all regrets, and all remembrances of my previous existence, <lb/>
in the wild enjoyments it afforded.</p>
<p>In my various wanderings through the vale, and as I became <lb/>
better acquainted with the character of its inhabitants, I was <lb/>
more and more struck with the light-hearted joyousness that <lb/>
everywhere prevailed. The minds of these simple savages, <lb/>
unoccupied by matters of graver moment, were capable of <reg orig="de-|riving">deriving</reg> <lb/>
the utmost delight from circumstances which would have <lb/>
passed unnoticed in more intelligent communities. All their <lb/>
enjoyment, indeed, seemed to be made up of the little trifling <lb/>
incidents of the passing hour; but these diminutive items swelled <lb/>
altogether to an amount of happiness seldom experienced by <lb/>
more enlightened individuals, whose pleasures are drawn from <lb/>
more elevated but rarer sources.</p>
<p>What community, for instance, of refined and intellectual <lb/>
mortals would derive the least satisfaction from shooting <reg orig="pop-|guns">popguns</reg>? <lb/>
The mere supposition of such a thing being possible <lb/>
would excite their indignation, and yet the whole population of <lb/>
Typee did little else for ten days but occupy themselves with that <lb/>
childish amusement, fairly screaming, too, with the delight it <lb/>
afforded them.</p>
<pb n="161" entity="z000000574_0188" pid="uva-lib:244640"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">M</fw></pb>
<p>One day I was frolicking with a little spirited urchin, some six <lb/>
years old, who chased me with a piece of bamboo about three feet <lb/>
long, with which he occasionally belaboured me. Seizing the <lb/>
stick from him, the idea happened to suggest itself, that I might <lb/>
make for the youngster, out of the slender tube, one of those <lb/>
nursery muskets with which I had sometimes seen children <reg orig="play-|ing">playing</reg>. <lb/>
Accordingly, with my knife I made two parallel slits in <lb/>
the cane several inches in length, and cutting loose at one end <lb/>
the elastic strip between them, bent it back and slipped the point <lb/>
into a little notch made for the purpose. Any small substance <lb/>
placed against this would be projected with considerable force <lb/>
through the tube, by merely springing the bent strip out of the <lb/>
notch.</p>
<p>Had I possessed the remotest idea of the sensation this piece of <lb/>
ordnance was destined to produce, I should certainly have taken <lb/>
out a patent for the invention. The boy scampered away with <lb/>
it, half delirious with ecstacy, and in twenty minutes afterwards <lb/>
I might have been seen surrounded by a noisy crowd&mdash;venerable <lb/>
old greybeards&mdash;responsible fathers of families&mdash;valiant warriors <lb/>
&mdash;matrons&mdash;young men&mdash;girls and children, all holding in their <lb/>
hand bits of bamboo, and each clamouring to be served first.</p>
<p>For three or four hours I was engaged in manufacturing <reg orig="pop-|guns">popguns</reg>, <lb/>
but at last made over my good-will and interest in the <reg orig="con-|cern">concern</reg> <lb/>
to a lad of remarkable quick parts, whom I soon initiated <lb/>
into the art and mystery.</p>
<p>Pop, Pop, Pop, Pop, now resounded all over the valley. <lb/>
Duels, skirmishes, pitched battles, and general engagements were <lb/>
to be seen on every side. Here, as you walked along a path <lb/>
which led through a thicket, you fell into a cunningly-laid <reg orig="am-|bush">ambush</reg>, <lb/>
and became a target for a body of musketeers whose <lb/>
tattooed limbs you could just see peeping into view through the <lb/>
foliage. There, you were assailed by the intrepid garrison of a <lb/>
house, who levelled their bamboo rifles at you from between the <lb/>
upright canes which composed its sides. Farther on you were <lb/>
fired upon by a detachment of sharpshooters, mounted upon the <lb/>
top of a pi-pi.</p>
<p>Pop, Pop, Pop, Pop! green guavas, seeds, and berries were <lb/>
flying about in every direction, and during this dangerous state of <lb/>
affairs I was half afraid that, like the man and his brazen bull, I <lb/>
<pb n="162" entity="z000000574_0189" pid="uva-lib:244641"/>
should fall a victim to my own ingenuity. Like everything else, <lb/>
however, the excitement gradually wore away, though ever after <lb/>
occasional pop-guns might be heard at all hours of the day.</p>
<p>It was towards the close of the pop-gun war, that I was <reg orig="infi-|nitely">infinitely</reg> <lb/>
diverted with a strange freak of Marheyo's.</p>
<p>I had worn, when I quitted the ship, a pair of thick pumps, <lb/>
which, from the rough usage they had received in scaling <reg orig="preci-|pices">precipices</reg> <lb/>
and sliding down gorges, were so dilapidated as to be <reg orig="alto-|gether">altogether</reg> <lb/>
unfit for use&mdash;so, at least, would have thought the <reg orig="gene-|rality">generality</reg> <lb/>
of people, and so they most certainly were, when <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg> <lb/>
in the light of shoes. But things unserviceable in one <lb/>
way, may with advantage be applied in another, that is, if one <lb/>
have genius enough for the purpose. This genius Marheyo <lb/>
possessed in a superlative degree, as he abundantly evinced by <lb/>
the use to which he put these sorely bruised and battered old <lb/>
shoes.</p>
<p>Every article, however trivial, which belonged to me, the <lb/>
natives appeared to regard as sacred; and I observed that for <lb/>
several days after becoming an inmate of the house, my pumps <lb/>
were suffered to remain, untouched, where I had first happened <lb/>
to throw them. I remembered, however, that after awhile I had <lb/>
missed them from their accustomed place; but the matter gave <lb/>
me no concern, supposing that Tinor&mdash;like any other tidy <reg orig="house-|wife">housewife</reg>, <lb/>
having come across them in some of her domestic <reg orig="occupa-|tions&mdash;had">occupations&mdash;had</reg> <lb/>
pitched the useless things out of the house. But I was <lb/>
soon undeceived.</p>
<p>One day I observed old Marheyo bustling about me with <reg orig="un-|usual">unusual</reg> <lb/>
activity, and to such a degree as almost to supersede <reg orig="Kory-|Kory">Kory-Kory</reg> <lb/>
in the functions of his office. One moment he volunteered <lb/>
to trot off with me on his back to the stream; and when I refused, <lb/>
noways daunted by the repulse he continued to frisk about me <lb/>
like a superannuated house-dog. I could not for the life of me <lb/>
conjecture what possessed the old gentleman, until all at once, <lb/>
availing himself of the temporary absence of the household, he <lb/>
went through a variety of uncouth gestures, pointing eagerly <lb/>
down to my feet, and then up to a little bundle which swung from <lb/>
the ridge-pole overhead. At last I caught a faint idea of his <lb/>
meaning, and motioned him to lower the package. He executed <lb/>
the order in the twinkling of an eye, and unrolling a piece of <lb/>
<pb n="163" entity="z000000574_0190" pid="uva-lib:244642"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">M 2</fw></pb>
tappa displayed to my astonished gaze the identical pumps which <lb/>
I thought had been destroyed long before.</p>
<p>I immediately comprehended his desires, and very generously <lb/>
gave him the shoes, which had become quite mouldy, wondering <lb/>
for what earthly purpose he could want them.</p>
<p>The same afternoon I descried the venerable warrior <reg orig="approach-|ing">approaching</reg> <lb/>
the house, with a slow, stately gait, ear-rings in ears, and <lb/>
spear in hand, with this highly ornamental pair of shoes suspended <lb/>
from his neck by a strip of bark, and swinging backwards and <lb/>
forwards on his capacious chest. In the gala costume of the <lb/>
tasteful Marheyo, these calf-skin pendants ever after formed the <lb/>
most striking feature.</p>
<p>But to turn to something a little more important. Although <lb/>
the whole existence of the inhabitants of the valley seemed to <lb/>
pass away exempt from toil, yet there were some light <reg orig="employ-|ments">employments</reg> <lb/>
which, although amusing rather than laborious as <reg orig="occupa-|tions">occupations</reg>, <lb/>
contributed to their comfort and luxury. Among these, <lb/>
the most important was the manufacture of the native cloth,&mdash; <lb/>
"tappa,"&mdash;so well known, under various modifications, <reg orig="through-|out">throughout</reg> <lb/>
the whole Polynesian Archipelago. As is generally <reg orig="under-|stood">understood</reg>, <lb/>
this useful and sometimes elegant article is fabricated <lb/>
from the bark of different trees. But, as I believe that no <reg orig="de-|scription">description</reg> <lb/>
of its manufacture has ever been given, I shall state <lb/>
what I know regarding it.</p>
<p>In the manufacture of the beautiful white tappa generally <lb/>
worn on the Marquesa Islands, the preliminary operation <reg orig="con-|sists">consists</reg> <lb/>
in gathering a certain quantity of the young branches of the <lb/>
cloth-tree. The exterior green bark being pulled off as <reg orig="worth-|less">worthless</reg>, <lb/>
there remains a slender fibrous substance, which is carefully <lb/>
stripped from the stick, to which it closely adheres. When a <lb/>
sufficient quantity of it has been collected, the various strips are <lb/>
enveloped in a covering of large leaves, which the natives use <lb/>
precisely as we do wrapping-paper, and which are secured by a <lb/>
few turns of a line passed round them. The package is then <lb/>
laid in the bed of some running stream, with a heavy stone placed <lb/>
over it, to prevent its being swept away. After it has remained <lb/>
for two or three days in this state, it is drawn out, and exposed, <lb/>
for a short time, to the action of the air, every distinct piece <lb/>
being attentively inspected, with a view of ascertaining whether <lb/>
<pb n="164" entity="z000000574_0191" pid="uva-lib:244643"/>
it has yet been sufficiently affected by the operation. This is <lb/>
repeated again and again, until the desired result is obtained.</p>
<p>When the substance is in a proper state for the next process, <lb/>
it betrays evidences of incipient decomposition; the fibres are <lb/>
relaxed and softened, and rendered perfectly malleable. The <lb/>
different strips are now extended, one by one, in successive layers, <lb/>
upon some smooth surface&mdash;generally the prostrate trunk of a <lb/>
cocoa-nut tree&mdash;and the heap thus formed is subjected, at every <lb/>
new increase, to a moderate beating, with a sort of wooden <lb/>
mallet, leisurely applied. The mallet is made of a hard heavy <lb/>
wood resembling ebony, is about twelve inches in length, and <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg> <lb/>
two in breadth, with a rounded handle at one end, and in <lb/>
shape is the exact counterpart of one of our four-sided razor-strops. <lb/>
The flat surfaces of the implement are marked with shallow <lb/>
parallel indentations, varying in depth on the different sides, so as <lb/>
to be adapted to the several stages of the operation. These marks <lb/>
produce the corduroy sort of stripes discernible in the tappa in its <lb/>
finished state. After being beaten in the manner I have described, <lb/>
the material soon becomes blended in one mass, which, moistened <lb/>
occasionally with water, is at intervals hammered out, by a kind <lb/>
of gold-beating process, to any degree of thinness required. In <lb/>
this way the cloth is easily made to vary in strength and <reg orig="thick-|ness">thickness</reg>, <lb/>
so as to suit the numerous purposes to which it is applied.</p>
<p>When the operation last described has been concluded, the <lb/>
new-made toppa is spread out on the grass to bleach and dry, <lb/>
and soon becomes of a dazzling whiteness. Sometimes, in the <lb/>
first stages of the manufacture, the substance is impregnated with <lb/>
a vegetable juice, which gives it a permanent colour. A rich <lb/>
brown and a bright yellow are occasionally seen, but the simple <lb/>
taste of the Typee people inclines them to prefer the natural tint.</p>
<p>The notable wife of Kammahammaha, the renowned conqueror <lb/>
and king of the Sandwich Islands, used to pride herself in the skill <lb/>
she displayed in dyeing her tappa with contrasting colours disposed <lb/>
in regular figures; and, in the midst of the innovations of the <lb/>
times, was regarded, towards the decline of her life, as a lady of <lb/>
the old school, clinging as she did to the national cloth, in <reg orig="pre-|ference">preference</reg> <lb/>
to the frippery of the European calicoes. But the art of <lb/>
printing the tappa is unknown upon the Marquesan Islands.</p>
<p>In passing along the valley, I was often attracted by the noise <lb/>
<pb n="165" entity="z000000574_0192" pid="uva-lib:244644"/>
of the mallet, which, when employed in the manufacture of the <lb/>
cloth, produces at every stroke of its hard, heavy wood, a clear, <lb/>
ringing, and musical sound, capable of being heard at a great <lb/>
distance. When several of these implements happen to be in <lb/>
operation at the same time, and near one another, the effect upon <lb/>
the ear of a person, at a little distance, is really charming.</p>

<p rend="center">History of a Day as usually spent in the Typee Valley&mdash;Dances of the <lb/>
Marquesan Girls.</p>
</argument>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Nothing</hi> can be more uniform and undiversified than the life <lb/>
of the Typees; one tranquil day of ease and happiness follows <lb/>
another in quiet succession; and with these unsophisticated <lb/>
savages the history of a day is the history of a life. I will, <lb/>
therefore, as briefly as I can, describe one of our days in the <lb/>
valley.</p>
<p>To begin with the morning. We were not very early risers <lb/>
&mdash;the sun would be shooting his golden spikes above the Happar <lb/>
mountain, ere I threw aside my tappa robe, and girding my long <lb/>
tunic about my waist, sallied out with Fayaway and Kory-Kory, <lb/>
and the rest of the household, and bent my steps towards the <lb/>
stream. Here we found congregated all those who dwelt in our <lb/>
section of the valley; and here we bathed with them. The <lb/>
fresh morning air and the cool flowing waters put both soul and <lb/>
body in a glow, and after a half-hour employed in this recreation, <lb/>
we sauntered back to the house&mdash;Tinor and Marheyo gathering <lb/>
dry sticks by the way for fire-wood; some of the young men <lb/>
laying the cocoa-nut trees under contribution as they passed <lb/>
beneath them; while Kory-Kory played his outlandish pranks <lb/>
for my particular diversion, and Fayaway and I, not arm in arm <lb/>
to be sure, but sometimes hand in hand, strolled along, with <lb/>
feelings of perfect charity for all the world, and especial <reg orig="good-|will">goodwill</reg> <lb/>
towards each other.</p>
<p>Our morning meal was soon prepared. The islanders are <lb/>
somewhat abstemious at this repast; reserving the more powerful <lb/>
efforts of their appetite to a later period of the day. For my <lb/>
own part, with the assistance of my valet, who, as I have before <lb/>
stated, always officiated as spoon on these occasions, I ate <lb/>
sparingly from one of Tinor's trenchers of poee-poee; which <lb/>
<pb n="167" entity="z000000574_0194" pid="uva-lib:244646"/>
was devoted exclusively for my own use, being mixed with the <lb/>
milky meat of ripe cocoa-nut. A section of a roasted bread-fruit, <lb/>
a small cake of "Amar," or a mess of "Cokoo," two or three <lb/>
bananas, or a Mawmee apple; an annuee, or some other <reg orig="agree-|able">agreeable</reg> <lb/>
and nutricious fruit served from day to day to diversify the <lb/>
meal, which was finished by tossing off the liquid contents of a <lb/>
young cocoa-nut or two.</p>
<p>While partaking of this simple repast, the inmates of Marheyo's <lb/>
house, after the style of the indolent Romans, reclined in sociable <lb/>
groups upon the divan of mats, and digestion was promoted by <lb/>
cheerful conversation.</p>
<p>After the morning meal was concluded, pipes were lighted; <lb/>
and among them my own especial pipe, a present from the noble <lb/>
Mehevi. The islanders, who only smoke a whiff or two at a <lb/>
time, and at long intervals, and who keep their pipes going from <lb/>
hand to hand continually, regarded my systematic smoking <lb/>
of four or five pipefuls of tobacco in succession, as something <lb/>
quite wonderful. When two or three pipes had circulated freely, <lb/>
the company gradually broke up. Marheyo went to the little <lb/>
hut he was for ever building. Tinor began to inspect her rolls of <lb/>
tappa, or employed her busy fingers in plaiting grass-mats. The <lb/>
girls anointed themselves with their fragrant oils, dressed their <lb/>
hair, or looked over their curious finery, and compared together <lb/>
their ivory trinkets, fashioned out of boar's tusks or whale's <lb/>
teeth. The young men and warriors produced their spears, <lb/>
paddles, canoe-gear, battle-clubs, and war-conchs, and <reg orig="occu-|pied">occupied</reg> <lb/>
themselves in carving all sorts of figures upon them with <lb/>
pointed bits of shell or flint, and adorning them, especially the <lb/>
war-conchs, with tassels of braided bark and tufts of human <lb/>
hair. Some, immediately after eating, threw themselves once <lb/>
more upon the inviting mats, and resumed the employment of <lb/>
the previous night, sleeping as soundly as if they had not closed <lb/>
their eyes for a week. Others sallied out into the groves, for <lb/>
the purpose of gathering fruit or fibres of bark and leaves; the <lb/>
last two being in constant requisition, and applied to a hundred <lb/>
uses. A few, perhaps, among the girls, would slip into the <lb/>
woods after flowers, or repair to the stream with small <reg orig="cala-|bashes">calabashes</reg> <lb/>
and cocoa-nut shells, in order to polish them by friction <lb/>
with a smooth stone in the water. In truth these innocent <lb/>
<pb n="168" entity="z000000574_0195" pid="uva-lib:244647"/>
people seemed to be at no loss for something to occupy their <lb/>
time; and it would be no light task to enumerate all their <lb/>
employments, or rather pleasures.</p>
<p>My own mornings I spent in a variety of ways. Sometimes <lb/>
I rambled about from house to house, sure of receiving a cordial <lb/>
welcome wherever I went; or from grove to grove, and from <lb/>
one shady place to another, in company with Kory-Kory and <lb/>
Fayaway, and a rabble rout of merry young idlers. Sometimes <lb/>
I was too indolent for exercise, and accepting one of the many <lb/>
invitations I was continually receiving, stretched myself out on <lb/>
the mats of some hospitable dwelling, and occupied myself <reg orig="plea-|santly">pleasantly</reg> <lb/>
either in watching the proceedings of those around me or <lb/>
taking part in them myself. Whenever I chose to do the latter, <lb/>
the delight of the islanders was boundless; and there was always <lb/>
a throng of competitors for the honour of instructing me in any <lb/>
particular craft. I soon became quite an accomplished hand at <lb/>
making tappa&mdash;could braid a grass sling as well as the best of <lb/>
them&mdash;and once, with my knife, carved the handle of a javelin <lb/>
so exquisitely, that I have no doubt, to this day, Karnoonoo, its <lb/>
owner, preserves it as a surprising specimen of my skill. As <lb/>
noon approached, all those who had wandered forth from our <lb/>
habitation, began to return; and when mid-day was fairly come <lb/>
scarcely a sound was to be heard in the valley: a deep sleep fell <lb/>
upon all. The luxurious siesta was hardly ever omitted, except <lb/>
by old Marheyo, who was so eccentric a character, that he <lb/>
seemed to be governed by no fixed principles whatever; but <reg orig="act-|ing">acting</reg> <lb/>
just according to the humour of the moment, slept, ate, or <lb/>
tinkered away at his little hut, without regard to the proprieties <lb/>
of time or place. Frequently he might have been seen taking <lb/>
a nap in the sun at noon-day, or a bath in the stream at <reg orig="mid-|night">midnight</reg>. <lb/>
Once I beheld him perched eighty feet from the ground, <lb/>
in the tuft of a cocoa-nut tree, smoking; and often I saw him <lb/>
standing up to the waist in water, engaged in plucking out the <lb/>
stray hairs of his beard, using a piece of muscle-shell for <lb/>
tweezers.</p>
<p>The noon-tide slumber lasted generally an hour and a half; <lb/>
very often longer; and after the sleepers had arisen from their <lb/>
mats they again had recourse to their pipes, and then made <reg orig="pre-|parations">preparations</reg> <lb/>
for the most important meal of the day.</p>
<pb n="169" entity="z000000574_0196" pid="uva-lib:244648"/>
<p>I, however, like those gentlemen of leisure who breakfast at <lb/>
home and dine at their club, almost invariably, during my <reg orig="in-|tervals">intervals</reg> <lb/>
of health, enjoyed the afternoon repast with the bachelor <lb/>
chiefs of the Ti, who were always rejoiced to see me, and lavishly <lb/>
spread before me all the good things which their larder afforded. <lb/>
Mehevi generally produced among other dainties a baked pig, <lb/>
an article which I have every reason to suppose was provided for <lb/>
my sole gratification.</p>
<p>The Ti was a right jovial place. It did my heart, as well as <lb/>
my body, good to visit it. Secure from female intrusion, there <lb/>
was no restraint upon the hilarity of the warriors, who, like the <lb/>
gentlemen of Europe after the cloth is drawn and the ladies <lb/>
retire, freely indulged their mirth.</p>
<p>After spending a considerable portion of the afternoon at the Ti, <lb/>
I usually found myself, as the cool of the evening came on, either <lb/>
sailing on the little lake with Fayaway, or bathing in the waters <lb/>
of the stream with a number of the savages, who, at this hour, <lb/>
always repaired thither. As the shadows of night approached <lb/>
Marheyo's household were once more assembled under his roof: <lb/>
tapers were lit, long and curious chants were raised, <reg orig="intermin-|able">interminable</reg> <lb/>
stories were told (for which one present was little the <lb/>
wiser), and all sorts of social festivities served to while away the <lb/>
time.</p>
<p>The young girls very often danced by moonlight in front of <lb/>
their dwellings. There are a great variety of these dances, in <lb/>
which, however, I never saw the men take part. They all <reg orig="con-|sist">consist</reg> <lb/>
of active, romping, mischievous evolutions, in which every <lb/>
limb is brought into requisition. Indeed, the Marquesan girls <lb/>
dance all over, as it were; not only do their feet dance, but <lb/>
their arms, hands, fingers, ay, their very eyes, seem to dance in <lb/>
their heads. In good sooth, they so sway their floating forms, <lb/>
arch their necks, toss aloft their naked arms, and glide, and swim, <lb/>
and whirl, that it was almost too much for a quiet, sober-minded, <lb/>
modest young man like myself.</p>
<p>The damsels wear nothing but flowers and their compendious <lb/>
gala tunics; and when they plume themselves for the dance, <lb/>
they look like a band of olive-coloured Sylphides on the point of <lb/>
taking wing.</p>
<p>Unless some particular festivity was going forward, the inmates <lb/>
<pb n="170" entity="z000000574_0197" pid="uva-lib:244649"/>
of Marheyo's house retired to their mats rather early in the <lb/>
evening; but not for the night, since, after slumbering lightly <lb/>
for a while, they rose again, relit their tapers, partook of the <lb/>
third and last meal of the day, at which poee-poee alone was eaten, <lb/>
and then, after inhaling a narcotic whiff from a pipe of tobacco, <lb/>
disposed themselves for the great business of night, sleep. <lb/>
With the Marquesans it might almost be styled the great <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg> <lb/>
of life, for they pass a large portion of their time in the <lb/>
arms of Somnus. The native strength of their constitutions is <lb/>
no way shown more emphatically than in the quantity of sleep <lb/>
they can endure. To many of them, indeed, life is little else <lb/>
than an often interrupted and luxurious nap.</p>

<note id="n2" place="foot" n="2"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>I presume this might be translated into "Strong Waters." Arva is the <lb/>
name bestowed upon a root the properties of which are both inebriating and <lb/>

 ooze forth from the crevices <lb/>
of a rock, and gliding down its mossy side, fall at last, in many <lb/>
clustering drops, into a natural basin of stone fringed round <lb/>
with grass and dewy-looking little violet-coloured flowers, as <lb/>
fresh and beautiful as the perpetual moisture they enjoy can <lb/>
make them.</p>
<p>The water is held in high estimation by the islanders, some of <lb/>
whom consider it an agreeable as well as a medicinal beverage; <lb/>
they bring it from the mountain in their calabashes, and store it <lb/>
away beneath heaps of leaves in some shady nook near the house. <lb/>
Old Marheyo had a great love for the waters of the spring. <lb/>
Every now and then he lugged off to the mountain a great <lb/>
round demijohn of a calabash, and, panting with his exertions, <lb/>
brought it back filled with his darling fluid.</p>
<p>The water tasted like a solution of a dozen disagreeable things, <lb/>
and was sufficiently nauseous to have made the fortune of the <lb/>
proprietor, had the spa been situated in the midst of any civilized <lb/>
community.</p>
<p>As I am no chemist, I cannot give a scientific analysis of the <lb/>
water. All I know about the matter is, that one day Marheyo <lb/>
<pb n="172" entity="z000000574_0199" pid="uva-lib:244651"/>
in my presence poured out the last drop from his huge calabash, <lb/>
and I observed at the bottom of the vessel a small quantity of <lb/>
gravelly sediment very much resembling our common sand. <lb/>
Whether this is always found in the water, and gives it its <reg orig="pecu-|liar">peculiar</reg> <lb/>
flavour and virtues, or whether its presence was merely <lb/>
incidental, I was not able to ascertain.</p>
<p>One day in returning from this spring by a circuitous path, I <lb/>
came upon a scene which reminded me of Stonehenge and the <lb/>
architectural labours of the Druid.</p>
<p>At the base of one of the mountains, and surrounded on all <lb/>
sides by dense groves, a series of vast terraces of stone rises, step <lb/>
by step, for a considerable distance up the hill side. These <lb/>
terraces cannot be less than one hundred yards in length and <lb/>
twenty in width. Their magnitude, however, is less striking <lb/>
than the immense size of the blocks composing them. Some of <lb/>
the stones, of an oblong shape, are from ten to fifteen feet in <lb/>
length, and five or six feet thick. Their sides are quite smooth, <lb/>
but though square, and of pretty regular formation, they bear <lb/>
no mark of the chisel. They are laid together without cement, <lb/>
and here and there show gaps between. The topmost terrace <lb/>
and the lower one are somewhat peculiar in their construction. <lb/>
They have both a quadrangular depression in the centre, leaving <lb/>
the rest of the terrace elevated several feet above it. In the <lb/>
intervals of the stones immense trees have taken root, and their <lb/>
broad boughs stretching far over, and interlacing together, <lb/>
support a canopy almost impenetrable to the sun. Overgrowing <lb/>
the greater part of them, and climbing from one to another, is <lb/>
a wilderness of vines, in whose sinewy embrace many of the <lb/>
stones lie half hidden, while in some places a thick growth of <lb/>
bushes entirely covers them. There is a wild pathway which <lb/>
obliquely crosses two of these terraces; and so profound is the <lb/>
shade, so dense the vegetation, that a stranger to the place might <lb/>
pass along it without being aware of their existence.</p>
<p>These structures bear every indication of a very high <reg orig="anti-|quity">antiquity</reg>, <lb/>
and Kory-Kory, who was my authority in all matters of <lb/>
scientific research, gave me to understand that they were coeval <lb/>
with the creation of the world; that the great gods themselves <lb/>
were the builders; and that they would endure until time shall <lb/>
be no more. Kory-Kory's prompt explanation, and his attributing <lb/>
<pb n="173" entity="z000000574_0200" pid="uva-lib:244652"/>
the work to a divine origin, at once convinced me that neither <lb/>
he nor the rest of his countrymen knew anything about them.</p>
<p>As I gazed upon this monument, doubtless the work of an <reg orig="ex-|tinct">extinct</reg> <lb/>
and forgotten race, thus buried in the green nook of an <lb/>
island at the ends of the earth, the existence of which was <reg orig="yester-|day">yesterday</reg> <lb/>
unknown, a stronger feeling of awe came over me than if I <lb/>
had stood musing at the mighty base of the Pyramid of Cheops. <lb/>
There are no inscriptions, no sculpture, no clue, by which to <lb/>
conjecture its history: nothing but the dumb stones. How <lb/>
many generations of those majestic trees which overshadow them <lb/>
have grown and flourished and decayed since first they were <lb/>
erected!</p>
<p>These remains naturally suggest many interesting reflections. <lb/>
They establish the great age of the island, an opinion which the <lb/>
builders of theories concerning the creation of the various groups <lb/>
in the South Seas are not always inclined to admit. For my own <lb/>
part, I think it just as probable that human beings were living <lb/>
in the valleys of the Marquesas three thousand years ago as that <lb/>
they were inhabiting the land of Egypt. The origin of the island <lb/>
of Nukuheva cannot be imputed to the coral insect; for <reg orig="inde-|fatigable">indefatigable</reg> <lb/>
as that wonderful creature is, it would be hardly <reg orig="mus-|cular">muscular</reg> <lb/>
enough to pile rocks one upon the other more than three <lb/>
thousand feet above the level of the sea. That the land may <lb/>
have been thrown up by a submarine volcano is as possible as <lb/>
anything else. No one can make an affidavit to the contrary, <lb/>
and therefore I will say nothing against the supposition: indeed, <lb/>
were geologists to assert that the whole continent of America <lb/>
had in like manner been formed by the simultaneous explosion <lb/>
of a train of Etnas laid under the water all the way from the <lb/>
North Pole to the parallel of Cape Horn, I am the last man in <lb/>
the world to contradict them.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned that the dwellings of the islanders <lb/>
were almost invariably built upon massive stone foundations, <lb/>
which they call pi-pis. The dimensions of these, however, as <lb/>
well as of the stones composing them, are comparatively small: <lb/>
but there are other and larger erections of a similar description <lb/>
comprising the "morais," or burying-grounds, and <reg orig="festival-|places">festival-places</reg>, <lb/>
in nearly all the valleys of the island. Some of these <lb/>
piles are so extensive, and so great a degree of labour and skill <lb/>
<pb n="174" entity="z000000574_0201" pid="uva-lib:244653"/>
must have been requisite in constructing them, that I can scarcely <lb/>
believe they were built by the ancestors of the present inhabitants. <lb/>
If indeed they were, the race has sadly deteriorated in their <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
of the mechanic arts. To say nothing of their habitual <lb/>
indolence, by what contrivance within the reach of so simple a <lb/>
people could such enormous masses have been moved or fixed in <lb/>
their places? and how could they with their rude implements <lb/>
have chiselled and hammered them into shape?</p>
<p>All of these larger pi-pis&mdash;like that of the Hoolah Hoolah <lb/>
ground in the Typee valley&mdash;bore incontestable marks of great <lb/>
age; and I am disposed to believe that their erection may be <reg orig="as-|cribed">ascribed</reg> <lb/>
to the same race of men who were the builders of the still <lb/>
more ancient remains I have just described.</p>
<p>According to Kory-Kory's account, the pi-pi upon which <lb/>
stands the Hoolah Hoolah ground was built a great many moons <lb/>
ago, under the direction of Monoo, a great chief and warrior, <lb/>
and, as it would appear, master-mason among the Typees. It <lb/>
was erected for the express purpose to which it is at present <reg orig="de-|voted">devoted</reg>, <lb/>
in the incredibly short period of one sun; and was <reg orig="dedi-|cated">dedicated</reg> <lb/>
to the immortal wooden idols by a grand festival, which <lb/>
lasted ten days and nights.</p>
<p>Among the smaller pi-pis, upon which stand the <reg orig="dwelling-|houses">dwelling-houses</reg> <lb/>
of the natives, I never observed any which intimated a <lb/>
recent erection. There are in every part of the valley a great <lb/>
many of these massive stone foundations which have no houses <lb/>
upon them. This is vastly convenient, for whenever an <reg orig="enter-|prising">enterprising</reg> <lb/>
islander chooses to emigrate a few hundred yards from <lb/>
the place where he was born, all he has to do in order to <reg orig="esta-|blish">establish</reg> <lb/>
himself in some new locality, is to select one of the many <lb/>
unappropriated pi-pis, and without further ceremony pitch his <lb/>
bamboo tent upon it.</p>

</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">From</hi> the time that my lameness had decreased, I had made a <lb/>
daily practice of visiting Mehevi at the Ti, who invariably gave <lb/>
me a most cordial reception. I was always accompanied in <lb/>
these excursions by Fayaway and the ever-present Kory-Kory. <lb/>
The former, as soon as we reached the vicinity of the Ti&mdash;which <lb/>
was rigorously tabooed to the whole female sex&mdash;withdrew to a <lb/>
neighbouring hut, as if her feminine delicacy restrained her from <lb/>
approaching a habitation which might be regarded as a sort of <lb/>
Bachelor's Hall.</p>
<p>And in good truth it might well have been so considered. <reg orig="Al-|though">Although</reg> <lb/>
it was the permanent residence of several distinguished <lb/>
chiefs, and of the noble Mehevi in particular, it was still at certain <lb/>
seasons the favourite haunt of all the jolly, talkative, and elderly <lb/>
savages of the vale, who resorted thither in the same way that <lb/>
similar characters frequent a tavern in civilized countries. There <lb/>
they would remain hour after hour, chatting, smoking, eating <lb/>
poee-poee, or busily engaged in sleeping for the good of their <lb/>
constitutions.</p>
<p>This building appeared to be the head-quarters of the valley, <lb/>
where all flying rumours concentrated; and to have seen it filled <lb/>
with a crowd of the natives, all males, conversing in animated <lb/>
clusters, while multitudes were continually coming and going, <lb/>
one would have thought it a kind of savage Exchange, where <lb/>
the rise and fall of Polynesian Stock was discussed.</p>
<p>Mehevi acted as supreme lord over the place, spending the <lb/>
greater portion of his time there: and often when, at particular <lb/>
hours of the day, it was deserted by nearly every one else except <lb/>
the verd-antique looking centenarians, who were fixtures in the <lb/>
<pb n="176" entity="z000000574_0203" pid="uva-lib:244655"/>
building, the chief himself was sure to be found enjoying his <lb/>
"otium cum dignitate" upon the luxurious mats which covered <lb/>
the floor. Whenever I made my appearance he invariably rose, <lb/>
and, like a gentleman doing the honours of his mansion, invited <lb/>
me to repose myself wherever I pleased, and calling out "<reg orig="tam-|maree">tammaree</reg>!" <lb/>
(boy), a little fellow would appear, and then retiring <lb/>
for an instant, return with some savoury mess, from which the <lb/>
chief would press me to regale myself. To tell the truth, <reg orig="Me-|hevi">Mehevi</reg> <lb/>
was indebted to the excellence of his viands for the honour <lb/>
of my repeated visits,&mdash;a matter which cannot appear singular, <lb/>
when it is borne in mind that bachelors, all the world over, are <lb/>
famous for serving up unexceptionable repasts.</p>
<p>One day, on drawing near to the Ti, I observed that extensive <lb/>
preparations were going forward, plainly betokening some <reg orig="ap-|proaching">approaching</reg> <lb/>
festival. Some of the symptoms reminded me of the <lb/>
stir produced among the scullions of a large hotel, where a grand <lb/>
jubilee dinner is about to be given. The natives were hurrying <lb/>
about hither and thither, engaged in various duties; some lugging <lb/>
off to the stream enormous hollow bamboos, for the purpose of <lb/>
filling them with water; others chasing furious-looking hogs <lb/>
through the bushes, in their endeavours to capture them; and <lb/>
numbers employed in kneading great mountains of poee-poee <lb/>
heaped up in huge wooden vessels.</p>
<p>After observing these lively indications for a while, I was <lb/>
attracted to a neighbouring grove by a prodigious squeaking <lb/>
which I heard there. On reaching the spot I found it proceeded <lb/>
from a large hog which a number of natives were forcibly <reg orig="hold-|ing">holding</reg> <lb/>
to the earth, while a muscular fellow, armed with a bludgeon, <lb/>
was ineffectually aiming murderous blows at the skull of the <lb/>
unfortunate porker. Again and again he missed his writhing <lb/>
and struggling victim, but though puffing and panting with his <lb/>
exertions, he still continued them; and after striking a sufficient <lb/>
number of blows to have demolished an entire drove of oxen, <lb/>
with one crashing stroke he laid him dead at his feet.</p>
<p>Without letting any blood from the body, it was immediately <lb/>
carried to a fire which had been kindled near at hand, and four <lb/>
savages taking hold of the carcass by its legs, passed it rapidly <lb/>
to and fro in the flames. In a moment the smell of burning <lb/>
bristles betrayed the object of this procedure. Having got thus <lb/>
<pb n="177" entity="z000000574_0204" pid="uva-lib:244656"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">N</fw></pb>
far in the matter, the body was removed to a little distance; <lb/>
and, being disembowelled, the entrails were laid aside as choice <lb/>
parts, and the whole carcass thoroughly washed with water. An <lb/>
ample thick green cloth, composed of the long thick leaves of a <lb/>
species of palm-tree, ingeniously tacked together with little pins <lb/>
of bamboo, was now spread upon the ground, in which the body <lb/>
being carefully rolled, it was borne to an oven previously <reg orig="pre-|pared">prepared</reg> <lb/>
to receive it. Here it was at once laid upon the heated <lb/>
stones at the bottom, and covered with thick layers of leaves, the <lb/>
whole being quickly hidden from sight by a mound of earth <lb/>
raised over it.</p>
<p>Such is the summary style in which the Typees convert <reg orig="per-|verse-minded">perverse-minded</reg> <lb/>
and rebellious hogs into the most docile and amiable <lb/>
pork; a morsel of which placed on the tongue melts like a soft <lb/>
smile from the lips of Beauty.</p>
<p>I commend their peculiar mode of proceeding to the <reg orig="consider-|ation">consideration</reg> <lb/>
of all butchers, cooks, and housewives. The hapless porker <lb/>
whose fate I have just rehearsed, was not the only one who <lb/>
suffered on that memorable day. Many a dismal grunt, many <lb/>
an imploring squeak, proclaimed what was going on throughout <lb/>
the whole extent of the valley; and I verily believe the <reg orig="first-|born">firstborn</reg> <lb/>
of every litter perished before the setting of that fatal sun.</p>
<p>The scene around the Ti was now most animated. Hogs and <lb/>
poee-poee were baking in numerous ovens, which, heaped up with <lb/>
fresh earth into slight elevations, looked like so many ant-hills. <lb/>
Scores of the savages were vigorously plying their stone pestles <lb/>
in preparing masses of poee-poee, and numbers were gathering <lb/>
green bread-fruit and young cocoa-nuts in the surrounding groves; <lb/>
while an exceeding great multitude, with a view of encouraging <lb/>
the rest in their labours, stood still, and kept shouting most <lb/>
lustily without intermission.</p>
<p>It is a peculiarity among these people, that when engaged in <lb/>
any employment they always make a prodigious fuss about it. So <lb/>
seldom do they ever exert themselves, that when they do work <lb/>
they seem determined that so meritorious an action shall not <lb/>
escape the observation of those around. If, for example, they <lb/>
have occasion to remove a stone to a little distance, which <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg> <lb/>
might be carried by two able-bodied men, a whole swarm <lb/>
gather about it, and, after a vast deal of palavering, lift it up <lb/>
<pb n="178" entity="z000000574_0205" pid="uva-lib:244657"/>
among them, every one struggling to get hold of it, and bear it <lb/>
off yelling and panting as if accomplishing some mighty <reg orig="achieve-|ment">achievement</reg>. <lb/>
Seeing them on these occasions, one is reminded of an <lb/>
infinity of black ants clustering about and dragging away to <lb/>
some hole the leg of a deceased fly.</p>
<p>Having for some time attentively observed these demonstrations <lb/>
of good cheer, I entered the Ti, where Mehevi sat complacently <lb/>
looking out upon the busy scene, and occasionally issuing his <lb/>
orders. The chief appeared to be in an extraordinary flow of <lb/>
spirits, and gave me to understand that on the morrow there <lb/>
would be grand doings in the Groves generally, and at the Ti <lb/>
in particular; and urged me by no means to absent myself. In <lb/>
commemoration of what event, however, or in honour of what <lb/>
distinguished personage, the feast was to be given, altogether <lb/>
passed my comprehension. Mehevi sought to enlighten my <lb/>
ignorance, but he failed as signally as when he had endeavoured <lb/>
to initiate me into the perplexing arcana of the taboo.</p>
<p>On leaving the Ti, Kory-Kory, who had as a matter of course <lb/>
accompanied me, observing that my curiosity remained unabated, <lb/>
resolved to make every thing plain and satisfactory. With <lb/>
this intent, he escorted me through the Taboo Groves, pointing <lb/>
out to my notice a variety of objects, and endeavoured to explain <lb/>
them in such an indescribable jargon of words, that it almost <lb/>
put me in bodily pain to listen to him. In particular, he led <lb/>
me to a remarkable pyramidical structure some three yards <lb/>
square at the base, and perhaps ten feet in height, which had <lb/>
lately been thrown up, and occupied a very conspicuous position. <lb/>
It was composed principally of large empty calabashes, with a <lb/>
few polished cocoa-nut shells, and looked not unlike a cenotaph <lb/>
of skulls. My cicerone perceived the astonishment with which <lb/>
I gazed at this monument of savage crockery, and immediately <lb/>
addressed himself to the task of enlightening me: but all in vain; <lb/>
and to this hour the nature of the monument remains a complete <lb/>
mystery to me. As, however, it formed so prominent a feature <lb/>
in the approaching revels, I bestowed upon the latter, in my own <lb/>
mind, the title of the "Feast of Calabashes."</p>
<p>The following morning, awaking rather late, I perceived the <lb/>
whole of Marheyo's family busily engaged in preparing for the <lb/>
festival. The old warrior himself was arranging in round balls <lb/>
<pb n="179" entity="z000000574_0206" pid="uva-lib:244658"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">N 2</fw></pb>
the two grey locks of hair that were suffered to grow from the <lb/>
crown of his head; his earrings and spear, both well polished, <lb/>
lay beside him, while the highly decorative pair of shoes hung <lb/>
suspended from a projecting cane against the side of the house. <lb/>
The young men were similarly employed; and the fair damsels, <lb/>
including Fayaway, were anointing themselves with "aka," <reg orig="ar-|ranging">arranging</reg> <lb/>
their long tresses, and performing other matters <reg orig="con-|nected">connected</reg> <lb/>
with the duties of the toilet.</p>
<p>Having completed their preparations, the girls now exhibited <lb/>
themselves in gala costume; the most conspicuous feature of <lb/>
which was a necklace of beautiful white flowers, with the stems <lb/>
removed, and strung closely together upon a single fibre of tappa. <lb/>
Corresponding ornaments were inserted in their ears, and woven <lb/>
garlands upon their heads. About their waist they wore a short <lb/>
tunic of spotless white tappa, and some of them superadded to <lb/>
this a mantle of the same material, tied in an elaborate bow upon <lb/>
the left shoulder, and falling about the figure in picturesque folds.</p>
<p>Thus arrayed, I would have matched the charming Fayaway <lb/>
against any beauty in the world.</p>
<p>People may say what they will about the taste evinced by our <lb/>
fashionable ladies in dress. Their jewels, their feathers, their <lb/>
silks, and their furbelows would have sunk into utter <reg orig="insignifi-|cance">insignificance</reg> <lb/>
beside the exquisite simplicity of attire adopted by the <lb/>
nymphs of the vale on this festive occasion. I should like to <lb/>
have seen a gallery of coronation beauties, at Westminster Abbey, <lb/>
confronted for a moment by this band of Island girls; their <reg orig="stiff-|ness">stiffness</reg>, <lb/>
formality, and affectation contrasted with the artless <reg orig="viva-|city">vivacity</reg> <lb/>
and unconcealed natural graces of these savage maidens. It <lb/>
would be the Venus de' Medici placed beside a milliner's doll.</p>
<p>It was not long before Kory-Kory and myself were left alone <lb/>
in the house, the rest of its inmates having departed for the <lb/>
Taboo Groves. My valet was all impatience to follow them; <lb/>
and was as fidgety about my dilatory movements as a diner out <lb/>
waiting hat in hand at the bottom of the stairs for some lagging <lb/>
companion. At last, yielding to his importunities, I set out for <lb/>
the Ti. As we passed the houses peeping out from the groves <lb/>
through which our route lay, I noticed that they were entirely <lb/>
deserted by their inhabitants.</p>
<p>When we reached the rock that abruptly terminated the path, <lb/>
<pb n="180" entity="z000000574_0207" pid="uva-lib:244659"/>
and concealed from us the festive scene, wild shouts and a <reg orig="con-|fused">confused</reg> <lb/>
blending of voices assured me that the occasion, whatever <lb/>
it might be, had drawn together a great multitude. Kory-Kory, <lb/>
previous to mounting the elevation, paused for a moment, like a <lb/>
dandy at a ball-room door, to put a hasty finish to his toilet. <lb/>
During this short interval, the thought struck me that I ought <lb/>
myself perhaps to be taking some little pains with my appearance. <lb/>
But as I had no holiday raiment, I was not a little puzzled to <lb/>
devise some means of decorating myself. However, as I felt <lb/>
desirous to create a sensation, I determined to do all that lay in <lb/>
my power; and knowing that I could not delight the savages <lb/>
more than by conforming to their style of dress, I removed from <lb/>
my person the large robe of tappa which I was accustomed to <lb/>
wear over my shoulders whenever I sallied into the open air, <lb/>
and remained merely girt about with a short tunic descending <lb/>
from my waist to my knees.</p>
<p>My quick-witted attendant fully appreciated the compliment <lb/>
I was paying to the costume of his race, and began more <reg orig="sedu-|lously">sedulously</reg> <lb/>
to arrange the folds of the one only garment which <lb/>
remained to me. Whilst he was doing this, I caught sight of a <lb/>
knot of young lasses, who were sitting near us on the grass <reg orig="sur-|rounded">surrounded</reg> <lb/>
by heaps of flowers which they were forming into <reg orig="gar-|lands">garlands</reg>. <lb/>
I motioned to them to bring some of their handywork <lb/>
to me; and in an instant a dozen wreaths were at my disposal. <lb/>
One of them I put round the apology for a hat which I had been <lb/>
forced to construct for myself out of palmetto-leaves, and some <lb/>
of the others I converted into a splendid girdle. These <reg orig="opera-|tions">operations</reg> <lb/>
finished, with the slow and dignified step of a full-dressed <lb/>
beau I ascended the rock.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> whole population of the valley seemed to be gathered within <lb/>
the precincts of the grove. In the distance could be seen the <lb/>
long front of the Ti, its immense piazza swarming with men, <lb/>
arrayed in every variety of fantastic costume, and all vociferating <lb/>
with animated gestures; while the whole interval between it and <lb/>
the place where I stood was enlivened by groups of females <lb/>
fancifully decorated, dancing, capering, and uttering wild <reg orig="excla-|mations">exclamations</reg>. <lb/>
As soon as they descried me they set up a shout of <lb/>
welcome; and a band of them came dancing towards me chanting <lb/>
as they approached some wild recitative. The change in my <lb/>
garb seemed to transport them with delight, and clustering about <lb/>
me on all sides, they accompanied me towards the Ti. When <lb/>
however we drew near it these joyous nymphs paused in their <lb/>
career, and parting on either side, permitted me to pass on to the <lb/>
now densely thronged building.</p>
<p>So soon as I mounted to the pi-pi I saw at a glance that the <lb/>
revels were fairly under way.</p>
<p>What lavish plenty reigned around!&mdash;Warwick feasting his <lb/>
retainers with beef and ale was a niggard to the noble Mehevi! <lb/>
&mdash;All along the piazza of the Ti were arranged elaborately <lb/>
carved canoe-shaped vessels, some twenty feet in length, filled <lb/>
with newly made poee-poee, and sheltered from the sun by the <lb/>
broad leaves of the banana. At intervals were heaps of green <lb/>
bread-fruit, raised in pyramidical stacks, resembling the regular <lb/>
piles of heavy shot to be seen in the yard of an arsenal. Inserted <lb/>
into the interstices of the huge stones which formed the pi-pi <lb/>
were large boughs of trees; hanging from the branches of which, <lb/>
and screened from the sun by their foliage, were innumerable <lb/>
little packages with leafy coverings, containing the meat of the <lb/>
numerous hogs which had been slain, done up in this manner to <lb/>
<pb n="182" entity="z000000574_0209" pid="uva-lib:244661"/>
make it more accessible to the crowd. Leaning against the railing <lb/>
of the piazza were an immense number of long, heavy bamboos, <lb/>
plugged at the lower end, and with their projecting muzzles <lb/>
stuffed with a wad of leaves. These were filled with water from <lb/>
the stream, and each of them might hold from four to five <lb/>
gallons.</p>
<p>The banquet being thus spread, nought remained but for <lb/>
every one to help himself at his pleasure. Accordingly not a <lb/>
moment passed but the transplanted boughs I have mentioned <lb/>
were rifled by the throng of the fruit they certainly had never <lb/>
borne before. Calabashes of poee-poee were continually being <lb/>
replenished from the extensive receptacle in which that article <lb/>
was stored, and multitudes of little fires were kindled about the <lb/>
Ti for the purpose of roasting the bread-fruit.</p>
<p>Within the building itself was presented a most extraordinary <lb/>
scene. The immense lounge of mats lying between the parallel <lb/>
rows of the trunks of cocoa-nut trees, and extending the entire <lb/>
length of the house, at least two hundred feet, was covered by <lb/>
the reclining forms of a host of chiefs and warriors, who were <lb/>
eating at a great rate, or soothing the cares of Polynesian life in <lb/>
the sedative fumes of tobacco. The smoke was inhaled from <lb/>
large pipes, the bowls of which, made out of small cocoa-nut <lb/>
shells, were curiously carved in strange heathenish devices. <lb/>
These were passed from mouth to mouth by the recumbent <lb/>
smokers, who, taking two or three prodigious whiffs, handed the <lb/>
pipe to his neighbour; sometimes for that purpose stretching <lb/>
indolently across the body of some dozing individual whose <lb/>
exertions at the dinner-table had already induced sleep.</p>
<p>The tobacco used among the Typees was of a very mild and <lb/>
pleasing flavour, and as I always saw it in leaves, and the natives <lb/>
appeared pretty well supplied with it, I was led to believe that it <lb/>
must have been the growth of the valley. Indeed Kory-Kory <lb/>
gave me to understand that this was the case; but I never saw a <lb/>
single plant growing on the island. At Nukuheva, and, I believe, <lb/>
in all the other valleys, the weed is very scarce, being only <reg orig="ob-|tained">obtained</reg> <lb/>
in small quantities from foreigners, and smoking is <reg orig="conse-|quently">consequently</reg> <lb/>
with the inhabitants of these places a very great luxury. <lb/>
How it was that the Typees were so well furnished with it I <lb/>
cannot divine. I should think them too indolent to devote any <lb/>
<pb n="183" entity="z000000574_0210" pid="uva-lib:244662"/>
attention to its culture; and, indeed, as far as my observation <lb/>
extended, not a single atom of the soil was under any other <lb/>
cultivation than that of shower and sunshine. The <reg orig="tobacco-|plant">tobacco-plant</reg>, <lb/>
however, like the sugar-cane, may grow wild in some <lb/>
remote part of the vale.</p>
<p>There were many in the Ti for whom the tobacco did not <lb/>
furnish a sufficient stimulus, and who accordingly had recourse to <lb/>
"arva," as a more powerful agent in producing the desired effect.</p>
<p>"Arva" is a root very generally dispersed over the South <lb/>
Seas, and from it is extracted a juice, the effects of which upon <lb/>
the system are at first stimulating in a moderate degree; but it <lb/>
soon relaxes the muscles, and exerting a narcotic influence <reg orig="pro-|duces">produces</reg> <lb/>
a luxurious sleep. In the valley this beverage was <reg orig="uni-|versally">universally</reg> <lb/>
prepared in the following way:&mdash;Some half-dozen young <lb/>
boys seated themselves in a circle around an empty wooden vessel, <lb/>
each one of them being supplied with a certain quantity of the <lb/>
roots of the "arva," broken into small bits and laid by his side. <lb/>
A cocoa-nut goblet of water was passed around the juvenile <lb/>
company, who rinsing their mouths with its contents, proceeded <lb/>
to the business before them. This merely consisted in thoroughly <lb/>
masticating the "arva," and throwing it mouthful after <reg orig="mouth-|ful">mouthful</reg> <lb/>
into the receptacle provided. When a sufficient quantity had <lb/>
been thus obtained water was poured upon the mass, and being <lb/>
stirred about with the forefinger of the right-hand, the <reg orig="prepara-|tion">preparation</reg> <lb/>
was soon in readiness for use. The "arva" has medicinal <lb/>
qualities.</p>
<p>Upon the Sandwich Islands it has been employed with no <lb/>
small success in the treatment of scrofulous affections, and in <lb/>
combating the ravages of a disease for whose frightful inroads <lb/>
the ill-starred inhabitants of that group are indebted to their <lb/>
foreign benefactors. But the tenants of the Typee valley, as <lb/>
yet exempt from these inflictions, generally employ the "arva" <lb/>
as a minister to social enjoyment, and a calabash of the liquid <lb/>
circulates among them as the bottle with us.</p>
<p>Mehevi, who was greatly delighted with the change in my <lb/>
costume, gave me a cordial welcome. He had reserved for me <lb/>
a most delectable mess of "cokoo," well knowing my partiality <lb/>
for that dish; and had likewise selected three or four young <lb/>
cocoa-nuts, several roasted bread-fruit, and a magnificent bunch <lb/>
<pb n="184" entity="z000000574_0211" pid="uva-lib:244663"/>
of bananas, for my especial comfort and gratification. These <lb/>
various matters were at once placed before me; but Kory-Kory <lb/>
deemed the banquet entirely insufficient for my wants until he <lb/>
had supplied me with one of the leafy packages of pork, which, <lb/>
notwithstanding the somewhat hasty manner in which it had <lb/>
been prepared, possessed a most excellent flavour, and was <reg orig="sur-|prisingly">surprisingly</reg> <lb/>
sweet and tender.</p>
<p>Pork is not a staple article of food among the people of the <lb/>
Marquesas, consequently they pay little attention to the <hi rend="italic">breeding</hi> <lb/>
of the swine. The hogs are permitted to roam at large in the <lb/>
groves, where they obtain no small part of their nourishment from <lb/>
the cocoa-nuts which continually fall from the trees. But it is <lb/>
only after infinite labour and difficulty, that the hungry animal can <lb/>
pierce the husk and shell so as to get at the meat. I have <reg orig="fre-|quently">frequently</reg> <lb/>
been amused at seeing one of them, after crunching the <lb/>
obstinate nut with his teeth for a long time unsuccessfully, get <lb/>
into a violent passion with it. He would then root furiously <lb/>
under the cocoa-nut, and, with a fling of his snout, toss it <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
him on the ground. Following it up, he would crunch at <lb/>
it again savagely for a moment, and the next knock it on one <lb/>
side, pausing immediately after, as if wondering how it could <lb/>
so suddenly have disappeared. In this way the persecuted <lb/>
cocoa-nuts were often chased half across the valley.</p>
<p>The second day of the Feast of Calabashes was ushered in <lb/>
by still more uproarious noises than the first. The skins of <reg orig="in-|numerable">innumerable</reg> <lb/>
sheep seemed to be resounding to the blows of an <lb/>
army of drummers. Startled from my slumbers by the din, I <lb/>
leaped up, and found the whole household engaged in making <lb/>
preparations for immediate departure. Curious to discover of <lb/>
what strange events these novel sounds might be the precursors, <lb/>
and not a little desirous to catch a sight of the instruments <lb/>
which produced the terrific noise, I accompanied the natives as <lb/>
soon as they were in readiness to depart for the Taboo Groves.</p>
<p>The comparatively open space that extended from the Ti <lb/>
toward the rock, to which I have before alluded as forming the <lb/>
ascent to the place was, with the building itself, now altogether <lb/>
deserted by the men, the whole distance being filled by bands <lb/>
of females, shouting and dancing under the influence of some <lb/>
strange excitement.</p>
<pb n="185" entity="z000000574_0212" pid="uva-lib:244664"/>
<p>I was amused at the appearance of four or five old women <lb/>
who, in a state of utter nudity, with their arms extended flatly <lb/>
down their sides, and holding themselves perfectly erect, were <lb/>
leaping stiffly into the air, like so many sticks bobbing to the <lb/>
surface, after being pressed perpendicularly into the water. <lb/>
They preserved the utmost gravity of countenance, and <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
their extraordinary movements without a single moment's <lb/>
cessation. They did not appear to attract the observation of the <lb/>
crowd around them, but I must candidly confess that, for my <lb/>
own part, I stared at them most pertinaciously.</p>
<p>Desirous of being enlightened with regard to the meaning <lb/>
of this peculiar diversion, I turned inquiringly to Kory-Kory; <lb/>
that learned Typee immediately proceeded to explain the whole <lb/>
matter thoroughly. But all that I could comprehend from what <lb/>
he said was, that the leaping figures before me were bereaved <lb/>
widows, whose partners had been slain in battle many moons <lb/>
previously; and who, at every festival, gave public evidence <lb/>
in this manner of their calamities. It was evident that <reg orig="Kory-|Kory">Kory-Kory</reg> <lb/>
considered this an all-sufficient reason for so indecorous a <lb/>
custom; but I must say that it did not satisfy me as to its <reg orig="pro-|priety">propriety</reg>.</p>
<p>Leaving these afflicted females, we passed on to the <reg orig="Hoolah-|Hoolah">HoolahHoolah</reg> <lb/>
ground. Within the spacious quadrangle, the whole <lb/>
population of the valley seemed to be assembled, and the sight <lb/>
presented was truly remarkable. Beneath the sheds of <reg orig="bam-|boo">bamboo</reg> <lb/>
which opened towards the interior of the square, reclined <lb/>
the principal chiefs and warriors, while a miscellaneous throng <lb/>
lay at their ease under the enormous trees which spread a <reg orig="ma-|jestic">majestic</reg> <lb/>
canopy overhead. Upon the terraces of the gigantic altars, <lb/>
at either end, were deposited green bread-fruit in baskets of <lb/>
cocoa-nut leaves, large rolls of tappa, bunches of ripe bananas, <lb/>
clusters of mammee-apples, the golden-hued fruit of the <reg orig="artu-|tree">artutree</reg>, <lb/>
and baked hogs, laid out in large wooden trenches, <reg orig="fanci-|fully">fancifully</reg> <lb/>
decorated with freshly plucked leaves, whilst a variety of <lb/>
rude implements of war were piled in confused heaps before the <lb/>
ranks of hideous idols. Fruits of various kinds were likewise <lb/>
suspended in leafen baskets, from the tops of poles planted <reg orig="up-|rightly">uprightly</reg>, <lb/>
and at regular intervals, along the lower terraces of <lb/>
both altars. At their base were arranged two parallel rows of <lb/>
<pb n="186" entity="z000000574_0213" pid="uva-lib:244665"/>
cumbersome drums, standing at least fifteen feet in height, and <lb/>
formed from the hollow trunks of large trees. Their heads <lb/>
were covered with shark skins, and their barrels were <reg orig="elabo-|rately">elaborately</reg> <lb/>
carved with various quaint figures and devices. At <lb/>
regular intervals they were bound round by a species of <reg orig="sin-|nate">sinnate</reg> <lb/>
of various colours, and strips of native cloth flattened upon <lb/>
them here and there. Behind these instruments were built <lb/>
slight platforms, upon which stood a number of young men <lb/>
who, beating violently with the palms of their hands upon <lb/>
the drum-heads, produced those outrageous sounds which had <lb/>
awakened me in the morning. Every few minutes these <reg orig="mu-|sical">musical</reg> <lb/>
performers hopped down from their elevation into the <lb/>
crowd below, and their places were immediately supplied by <lb/>
fresh recruits. Thus an incessant din was kept up that might <lb/>
have startled Pandemonium.</p>
<p>Precisely in the middle of the quadrangle were placed <reg orig="per-|pendicularly">perpendicularly</reg> <lb/>
in the ground, a hundred or more slender, fresh-cut <lb/>
poles, stripped of their bark, and decorated at the end with a <lb/>
floating pennon of white tappa; the whole being fenced about <lb/>
with a little picket of canes. For what purpose these singular <lb/>
ornaments were intended I in vain endeavoured to discover.</p>
<p>Another most striking feature of the performance was <reg orig="ex-|hibited">exhibited</reg> <lb/>
by a score of old men, who sat cross-legged in the little <lb/>
pulpits, which encircled the trunks of the immense trees <reg orig="grow-|ing">growing</reg> <lb/>
in the middle of the enclosure. These venerable gentlemen, <lb/>
who I presume were the priests, kept up an uninterrupted <reg orig="mo-|notonous">monotonous</reg> <lb/>
chant, which was nearly drowned in the roar of drums. <lb/>
In the right hand they held a finely woven grass fan, with a <lb/>
heavy black wooden handle curiously chased: these fans they <lb/>
kept in continual motion.</p>
<p>But no attention whatever seemed to be paid to the drummers <lb/>
or to the old priests; the individuals who composed the vast <lb/>
crowd present being entirely taken up in chatting and laughing <lb/>
with one another, smoking, drinking arva, and eating. For all <lb/>
the observation it attracted, or the good it achieved, the whole <lb/>
savage orchestra might, with great advantage to its own <reg orig="mem-|bers">members</reg> <lb/>
and the company in general, have ceased the prodigious <lb/>
uproar they were making.</p>
<p>In vain I questioned Kory-Kory and others of the natives, <lb/>
<pb n="187" entity="z000000574_0214" pid="uva-lib:244666"/>
as to the meaning of the strange things that were going on; all <lb/>
their explanations were conveyed in such a mass of outlandish <lb/>
gibberish and gesticulation that I gave up the attempt in <reg orig="de-|spair">despair</reg>. <lb/>
All that day the drums resounded, the priests chanted, <lb/>
and the multitude feasted and roared till sunset, when the <lb/>
throng dispersed, and the Taboo Groves were again abandoned <lb/>
to quiet and repose. The next day the same scene was repeated <lb/>
until night, when this singular festival terminated.</p>

</argument>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Although</hi> I had been baffled in my attempts to learn the origin <lb/>
of the Feast of Calabashes, yet it seemed very plain to me that <lb/>
it was principally, if not wholly, of a religious character. As a <lb/>
religious solemnity, however, it had not at all corresponded with <lb/>
the horrible descriptions of Polynesian worship which we have <lb/>
received in some published narratives, and especially in those <lb/>
accounts of the evangelized islands with which the missionaries <lb/>
have favoured us. Did not the sacred character of these persons <lb/>
render the purity of their intentions unquestionable, I should <lb/>
certainly be led to suppose that they had exaggerated the evils <lb/>
of Paganism, in order to enhance the merit of their own <reg orig="disin-|terested">disinterested</reg> <lb/>
labours.</p>
<p>In a certain work incidentally treating of the `Washington, or <lb/>
Northern Marquesas Islands,' I have seen the frequent immolation <lb/>
of human victims upon the altars of their gods, positively and <lb/>
repeatedly charged upon the inhabitants. The same work gives <lb/>
also a rather minute account of their religion,&mdash;enumerates a <lb/>
great many of their superstitions,&mdash;and makes known the <reg orig="par-|ticular">particular</reg> <lb/>
designations of numerous orders of the priesthood. One <lb/>
would almost imagine from the long list that is given of cannibal <lb/>
primates, bishops, archdeacons, prebendaries, and other inferior <lb/>
ecclesiastics, that the sacerdotal order far outnumbered the rest <lb/>
of the population, and that the poor natives were more severely <lb/>
priest-ridden than even the inhabitants of the papal states. <lb/>
These accounts are likewise calculated to leave upon the reader's <lb/>
mind an impression that human victims are daily cooked and <lb/>
served up upon the altars; that heathenish cruelties of every <reg orig="de-|scription">description</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="189" entity="z000000574_0216" pid="uva-lib:244668"/>
are continually practised; and that these ignorant <lb/>
Pagans are in a state of the extremest wretchedness in <reg orig="conse-|quence">consequence</reg> <lb/>
of the grossness of their superstitions. Be it observed, <lb/>
however, that all this information is given by a man who, <reg orig="accord-|ing">according</reg> <lb/>
to his own statement, was only at one of the islands and <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg> <lb/>
there but two weeks, sleeping every night on board his <lb/>
ship, and taking little kid-glove excursions ashore in the <reg orig="day-|time">daytime</reg>, <lb/>
attended by an armed party.</p>
<p>Now, all I can say is, that in all my excursions through <lb/>
the valley of Typee, I never saw any of these alleged enormities. <lb/>
If any of them are practised upon the Marquesas Islands they <lb/>
must certainly have come to my knowledge while living for <lb/>
months with a tribe of savages, wholly unchanged from their <lb/>
original primitive condition, and reputed the most ferocious in <lb/>
the South Seas.</p>
<p>The fact is, that there is a vast deal of unintentional humbuggery <lb/>
in some of the accounts we have from scientific men concerning <lb/>
the religious institutions of Polynesia. These learned tourists <lb/>
generally obtain the greater part of their information from the <lb/>
retired old South-Sea rovers, who have domesticated themselves <lb/>
among the barbarous tribes of the Pacific. Jack, who has long <lb/>
been accustomed to the long-bow, and to spin tough yarns on a <lb/>
ship's forecastle, invariably officiates as showman of the island <lb/>
on which he has settled, and having mastered a few dozen words <lb/>
of the language, is supposed to know all about the people who <lb/>
speak it. A natural desire to make himself of consequence in <lb/>
the eyes of the strangers, prompts him to lay claim to a much <lb/>
greater knowledge of such matters than he actually possesses. In <lb/>
reply to incessant queries, he communicates not only all he <lb/>
knows but a good deal more, and if there be any information <lb/>
deficient still he is at no loss to supply it. The avidity with <lb/>
which his anecdotes are noted down tickles his vanity, and his <lb/>
powers of invention increase with the credulity of his auditors. <lb/>
He knows just the sort of information wanted, and furnishes it <lb/>
to any extent.</p>
<p>This is not a supposed case; I have met with several <reg orig="indi-|viduals">individuals</reg> <lb/>
like the one described, and I have been present at two or <lb/>
three of their interviews with strangers.</p>
<p>Now, when the scientific voyager arrives at home with his <reg orig="col-|lection">collection</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="190" entity="z000000574_0217" pid="uva-lib:244669"/>
of wonders, he attempts, perhaps, to give a description <lb/>
of some of the strange people he has been visiting. Instead of <lb/>
representing them as a community of lusty savages, who are <lb/>
leading a merry, idle, innocent life, he enters into a very <reg orig="circum-|stantial">circumstantial</reg> <lb/>
and learned narrative of certain unaccountable <reg orig="supersti-|tions">superstitions</reg> <lb/>
and practices, about which he knows as little as the islanders <lb/>
do themselves. Having had little time, and scarcely any <reg orig="oppor-|tunity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
to become acquainted with the customs he pretends to <lb/>
describe, he writes them down one after another in an off-hand, <lb/>
haphazard style; and were the book thus produced to be <reg orig="trans-|lated">translated</reg> <lb/>
into the tongue of the people of whom it purports to give <lb/>
the history, it would appear quite as wonderful to them as it <lb/>
does to the American public, and much more improbable.</p>
<p>For my own part, I am free to confess my almost entire <reg orig="in-|ability">inability</reg> <lb/>
to gratify any curiosity that may be felt with regard to <lb/>
the theology of the valley. I doubt whether the inhabitants <lb/>
themselves could do so. They are either too lazy or too sensible <lb/>
to worry themselves about abstract points of religious belief. <lb/>
While I was among them they never held any synods or councils <lb/>
to settle the principles of their faith by agitating them. An <reg orig="un-|bounded">unbounded</reg> <lb/>
liberty of conscience seemed to prevail. Those who <lb/>
pleased to do so were allowed to repose implicit faith in an <reg orig="ill-|favoured">ill-favoured</reg> <lb/>
god with a large bottle nose and fat shapeless arms <lb/>
crossed upon his breast, whilst others worshipped an image <lb/>
which, having no likeness either in heaven or on earth, could <lb/>
hardly be called an idol. As the islanders always maintained a <lb/>
discreet reserve, with regard to my own peculiar views on <reg orig="reli-|gion">religion</reg>, <lb/>
I thought it would be excessively ill-bred in me to pry <lb/>
into theirs.</p>
<p>But, although my knowledge of the religious faith of the <lb/>
Typees was unavoidably limited, one of their superstitious <reg orig="ob-|servances">observances</reg> <lb/>
with which I became acquainted interested me greatly.</p>
<p>In one of the most secluded portions of the valley within a <lb/>
stone's cast of Fayaway's lake&mdash;for so I christened the scene of <lb/>
our island yachting&mdash;and hard by a growth of palms, which stood <lb/>
ranged in order along both banks of the stream, waving their <lb/>
green arms as if to do honour to its passage, was the mausoleum <lb/>
of a deceased warrior chief. Like all the other edifices of any <lb/>
note, it was raised upon a small pi-pi of stones, which, being of <lb/>
<pb n="191" entity="z000000574_0218" pid="uva-lib:244670"/>
unusual height, was a conspicuous object from a distance. A <lb/>
light thatching of bleached palmetto leaves hung over it like a <lb/>
self-supported canopy; for it was not until you came very near <lb/>
that you saw it was supported by four slender columns of bamboo <lb/>
rising at each corner to a little more than the height of a man. <lb/>
A clear area of a few yards surrounded the pi-pi, and was <reg orig="en-|closed">enclosed</reg> <lb/>
by four trunks of cocoa-nut trees resting at the angles on <lb/>
massive blocks of stone. The place was sacred. The sign of the <lb/>
inscrutable taboo was seen in the shape of a mystic roll of white <lb/>
tappa, suspended by a twisted cord of the same material from <lb/>
the top of a slight pole planted within the enclosure.<ref target="n3" n="3">*</ref>
<note id="n3" place="foot" n="3"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>White appears to be the sacred colour among the Marquesans.</p></note>
 The <lb/>
sanctity of the spot appeared never to have been violated. The <lb/>
stillness of the grave was there, and the calm solitude around was <lb/>
beautiful and touching. The soft shadows of those lofty <reg orig="palm-|trees!&mdash;I">palmtrees!&mdash;I</reg> <lb/>
can see them now&mdash;hanging over the little temple, as <lb/>
if to keep out the intrusive sun.</p>
<p>On all sides as you approached this silent spot you caught <lb/>
sight of the dead chief's effigy, seated in the stern of a canoe, <lb/>
which was raised on a light frame a few inches above the level <lb/>
of the pi-pi. The canoe was about seven feet in length; of a <lb/>
rich, dark coloured wood, handsomely carved and adorned in <lb/>
many places with variegated bindings of stained sinnate, into <lb/>
which were ingeniously wrought a number of sparkling <reg orig="sea-|shells">seashells</reg>, <lb/>
and a belt of the same shells ran all round it. The body <lb/>
of the figure&mdash;of whatever material it might have been made&mdash; <lb/>
was effectually concealed in a heavy robe of brown tappa, <reg orig="re-|vealing">revealing</reg> <lb/>
only the hands and head; the latter skilfully carved in <lb/>
wood, and surmounted by a superb arch of plumes. These plumes, <lb/>
in the subdued and gentle gales which found access to this <reg orig="se-|questered">sequestered</reg> <lb/>
spot, were never for one moment at rest, but kept <lb/>
nodding and waving over the chief's brow. The long leaves of <lb/>
the palmetto dropped over the eaves, and through them you saw <lb/>
the warrior holding his paddle with both hands in the act of <lb/>
rowing, leaning forward and inclining his head, as if eager to <lb/>
hurry on his voyage. Glaring at him for ever, and face to face, <lb/>
was a polished human skull, which crowned the prow of the <lb/>
canoe. The spectral figure-head, reversed in its position, glancing <lb/>
backwards, seemed to mock the impatient attitude of the warrior.</p>
<p>When I first visited this singular place with Kory-Kory, he <lb/>
<pb n="192" entity="z000000574_0219" pid="uva-lib:244671"/>
told me&mdash;or at least I so understood him&mdash;that the chief was <lb/>
paddling his way to the realms of bliss, and bread-fruit&mdash;the <lb/>
Polynesian heaven&mdash;where every moment the bread-fruit trees <lb/>
dropped their ripened spheres to the ground, and where there <lb/>
was no end to the cocoa-nuts and bananas: there they reposed <lb/>
through the livelong eternity upon mats much finer than those <lb/>
of Typee; and every day bathed their glowing limbs in rivers of <lb/>
cocoa-nut oil. In that happy land there were plenty of plumes <lb/>
and feathers, and boars'-tusks and sperm-whale teeth, far <reg orig="prefer-|able">preferable</reg> <lb/>
to all the shining trinkets and gay tappa of the white men; <lb/>
and, best of all, women far lovelier than the daughters of earth <lb/>
were there in abundance. "A very pleasant place," Kory-Kory <lb/>
said it was; "but after all, not much pleasanter, he thought, <lb/>
than Typee." "Did he not then," I asked him, "wish to <reg orig="ac-|company">accompany</reg> <lb/>
the warrior?" "Oh, no: he was very happy where he <lb/>
was; but supposed that some time or other he would go in his <lb/>
own canoe."</p>
<p>Thus far, I think, I clearly comprehended Kory-Kory. But <lb/>
there was a singular expression he made use of at the time, <reg orig="en-|forced">enforced</reg> <lb/>
by as singular a gesture, the meaning of which I would <lb/>
have given much to penetrate. I am inclined to believe it must <lb/>
have been a proverb he uttered; for I afterwards heard him <lb/>
repeat the same words several times, and in what appeared to me <lb/>
to be a somewhat similar sense. Indeed, Kory-Kory had a great <lb/>
variety of short, smart-sounding sentences, with which he <reg orig="fre-|quently">frequently</reg> <lb/>
enlivened his discourse; and he introduced them with an <lb/>
air which plainly intimated, that, in his opinion, they settled the <lb/>
matter in question, whatever it might be.</p>
<p>Could it have been then, that when I asked him whether he <lb/>
desired to go to this heaven of bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and young <lb/>
ladies, which he had been describing, he answered by saying <lb/>
something equivalent to our old adage&mdash;"A bird in the hand is <lb/>
worth two in the bush?"&mdash;if he did, Kory-Kory was a discreet <lb/>
and sensible fellow, and I cannot sufficiently admire his <reg orig="shrewd-|ness">shrewdness</reg>.</p>
<p>Whenever in the course of my rambles through the valley I <lb/>
happened to be near the chief's mausoleum, I always turned <lb/>
aside to visit it. The place had a peculiar charm for me; I <lb/>
hardly know why; but so it was. As I leaned over the railing <lb/>
<pb n="193" entity="z000000574_0220" pid="uva-lib:244672"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">O</fw></pb>
and gazed upon the strange effigy and watched the play of the <lb/>
feathery head-dress, stirred by the same breeze which in low <lb/>
tones breathed amidst the lofty palm-trees, I loved to yield myself <lb/>
up to the fanciful superstition of the islanders, and could almost <lb/>
believe that the grim warrior was bound heavenward. In this <lb/>
mood when I turned to depart, I bade him "God speed, and a <lb/>
pleasant voyage." Aye, paddle away, brave chieftain, to the <lb/>
land of spirits! To the material eye thou makest but little <reg orig="pro-|gress">progress</reg>; <lb/>
but with the eye of faith, I see thy canoe cleaving the <lb/>
bright waves, which die away on those dimly looming shores of <lb/>
Paradise.</p>
<p>This strange superstition affords another evidence of the fact, <lb/>
that however ignorant man may be, he still feels within him his <lb/>
immortal spirit yearning after the unknown future.</p>
<p>Although the religious theories of the islands were a complete <lb/>
mystery to me, their practical every-day operation could not be <lb/>
concealed. I frequently passed the little temples reposing in the <lb/>
shadows of the taboo groves and beheld the offerings&mdash;mouldy <lb/>
fruit spread out upon a rude altar, or hanging in half-decayed <lb/>
baskets around some uncouth jolly-looking image; I was present <lb/>
during the continuance of the festival; I daily beheld the <reg orig="grin-|ning">grinning</reg> <lb/>
idols marshalled rank and file in the Hoolah Hoolah ground, <lb/>
and was often in the habit of meeting those whom I supposed to <lb/>
be the priests. But the temples seemed abandoned to solitude; <lb/>
the festival had been nothing more than a jovial mingling of the <lb/>
tribe; the idols were quite as harmless as any other logs of wood; <lb/>
and the priests were the merriest dogs in the valley.</p>
<p>In fact religious affairs in Typee were at a very low ebb: all <lb/>
such matters sat very lightly upon the thoughtless inhabitants; <lb/>
and, in the celebration of many of their strange rites, they <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
merely to seek a sort of childish amusement.</p>
<p>A curious evidence of this was given in a remarkable <reg orig="cere-|mony">ceremony</reg> <lb/>
in which I frequently saw Mehevi and several other chiefs <lb/>
and warriors of note take part; but never a single female.</p>
<p>Among those whom I looked upon as forming the priesthood <lb/>
of the valley, there was one in particular who often attracted my <lb/>
notice, and whom I could not help regarding as the head of the <lb/>
order. He was a noble looking man, in the prime of his life, and <lb/>
of a most benignant aspect. The authority this man, whose name <lb/>
<pb n="194" entity="z000000574_0221" pid="uva-lib:244673"/>
was Kolory, seemed to exercise over the rest, the episcopal part <lb/>
he took in the Feast of Calabashes, his sleek and complacent <lb/>
appearance, the mystic characters which were tattooed upon his <lb/>
chest, and above all the mitre he frequently wore, in the shape <lb/>
of a towering head-dress, consisting of part of a cocoa-nut branch, <lb/>
the stalk planted uprightly on his brow, and the leaflets gathered <lb/>
together and passed round the temples and behind the ears, all <lb/>
these pointed him out as Lord Primate of Typee. Kolory was <lb/>
a sort of Knight Templar&mdash;a soldier-priest; for he often wore <lb/>
the dress of a Marquesan warrior, and always carried a long spear, <lb/>
which, instead of terminating in a paddle at the lower end, after <lb/>
the general fashion of these weapons, was curved into a <reg orig="heathen-|ish-looking">heathenish-looking</reg> <lb/>
little image. This instrument, however, might <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg> <lb/>
have been emblematic of his double functions. With one <lb/>
end in carnal combat he transfixed the enemies of his tribe; and <lb/>
with the other as a pastoral crook he kept in order his spiritual <lb/>
flock. But this is not all I have to say about Kolory. His <lb/>
martial grace very often carried about with him what seemed to <lb/>
me the half of a broken war-club. It was swathed round with <lb/>
ragged bits of white tappa, and the upper part, which was <reg orig="in-|tended">intended</reg> <lb/>
to represent a human head, was embellished with a strip <lb/>
of scarlet cloth of European manufacture. It required little <lb/>
observation to discover that this strange object was revered as <lb/>
a god. By the side of the big and lusty images standing sentinel <lb/>
over the altars of the Hoolah Hoolah ground, it seemed a mere <lb/>
pigmy in tatters. But appearances all the world over are <reg orig="decep-|tive">deceptive</reg>. <lb/>
Little men are sometimes very potent, and rags sometimes <lb/>
cover very extensive pretensions. In fact, this funny little <lb/>
image was the "crack" god of the island; lording it over all <lb/>
the wooden lubbers who looked so grim and dreadful; its name <lb/>
was Moa Artua.<ref target="n4" n="4">*</ref>
<note id="n4" place="foot" n="4"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>The word "Artua," although having some other significations, is in <lb/>
nearly all the Polynesian dialects used as the general designation of <lb/>
the gods.</p></note>
 And it was in honour of Moa Artua, and <lb/>
for the entertainment of those who believe in him, that the <lb/>
curious ceremony I am about to describe was observed.</p>
<p>Mehevi and the chieftains of the Ti have just risen from their <lb/>
noontide slumbers. There are no affairs of state to dispose of; <lb/>
and having eaten two or three breakfasts in the course of the <lb/>
<pb n="195" entity="z000000574_0222" pid="uva-lib:244674"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">O 2</fw></pb>
morning, the magnates of the valley feel no appetite as yet for <lb/>
dinner. How are their leisure moments to be occupied? They <lb/>
smoke, they chat, and at last one of their number makes a <reg orig="pro-|position">proposition</reg> <lb/>
to the rest, who joyfully acquiescing, he darts out of the <lb/>
house, leaps from the pi-pi, and disappears in the grove. Soon <lb/>
you see him returning with Kolory, who bears the god Moa <lb/>
Artua in his arms, and carries in one hand a small trough, <reg orig="hol-|lowed">hollowed</reg> <lb/>
out in the likeness of a canoe. The priest comes along <lb/>
dandling his charge as if it were a lachrymose infant he was <reg orig="en-|deavouring">endeavouring</reg> <lb/>
to put into a good humour. Presently, entering the <lb/>
Ti, he seats himself on the mats as composedly as a juggler about <lb/>
to perform his sleight-of-hand tricks; and with the chiefs <reg orig="dis-|posed">disposed</reg> <lb/>
in a circle around him, commences his ceremony.</p>
<p>In the first place he gives Moa Artua an affectionate hug, <lb/>
then caressingly lays him to his breast, and, finally, whispers <lb/>
something in his ear; the rest of the company listening eagerly <lb/>
for a reply. But the baby-god is deaf or dumb, &mdash; perhaps both, <lb/>
for never a word does he utter. At last Kolory speaks a little <lb/>
louder, and soon growing angry, comes boldly out with what <lb/>
he has to say and bawls to him. He put me in mind of a <lb/>
choleric fellow, who, after trying in vain to communicate a secret <lb/>
to a deaf man, all at once flies into a passion and screams it out <lb/>
so that every one may hear. Still Moa Artua remains as quiet <lb/>
as ever; and Kolory, seemingly losing his temper, fetches him a <lb/>
box over the head, strips him of his tappa and red cloth, and <lb/>
laying him in a state of nudity in the little trough, covers him <lb/>
from sight. At this proceeding all present loudly applaud and <lb/>
signify their approval by uttering the adjective "motarkee" <lb/>
with violent emphasis. Kolory, however, is so desirous his <reg orig="con-|duct">conduct</reg> <lb/>
should meet with unqualified approbation, that he inquires <lb/>
of each individual separately whether, under existing <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg>, <lb/>
he has not done perfectly right in shutting up Moa Artua. <lb/>
The invariable response is "Aa, Aa" (yes, yes), repeated over <lb/>
again and again in a manner which ought to quiet the scruples <lb/>
of the most conscientious. After a few moments Kolory brings <lb/>
forth his doll again, and while arraying it very carefully in the <lb/>
tappa and red cloth, alternately fondles and chides it. The toilet <lb/>
being completed, he once more speaks to it aloud. The whole <lb/>
company hereupon show the greatest interest; while the <unclear id="u1">prien</unclear> <lb/>
<pb n="196" entity="z000000574_0223" pid="uva-lib:244675"/>
holding Moa Artua to his ear interprets to them what he pretends <lb/>
the god is confidentially communicating to him. Some items of <lb/>
intelligence appear to tickle all present amazingly; for one claps <lb/>
his hands in a rapture; another shouts with merriment; and a <lb/>
third leaps to his feet and capers about like a madman.</p>
<p>What under the sun Moa Artua on these occasions had to say <lb/>
to Kolory I never could find out; but I could not help thinking <lb/>
that the former showed a sad want of spirit in being disciplined <lb/>
into making those disclosures, which at first he seemed bent on <lb/>
withholding. Whether the priest honestly interpreted what he <lb/>
believed the divinity said to him, or whether he was not all the <lb/>
while guilty of a vile humbug, I shall not presume to decide. <lb/>
At any rate, whatever as coming from the god was imparted to <lb/>
those present seemed to be generally of a complimentary nature: <lb/>
a fact which illustrates the sagacity of Kolory, or else the <reg orig="time-|serving">timeserving</reg> <lb/>
disposition of this hardly used deity.</p>
<p>Moa Artua having nothing more to say, his bearer goes to <lb/>
nursing him again, in which occupation, however, he is soon <reg orig="in-|terrupted">interrupted</reg> <lb/>
by a question put by one of the warriors to the god. <lb/>
Kolory hereupon snatches it up to his ear again, and after <reg orig="list-|ening">listening</reg> <lb/>
attentively, once more officiates as the organ of <reg orig="communi-|cation">communication</reg>. <lb/>
A multitude of questions and answers having passed <lb/>
between the parties, much to the satisfaction of those who <reg orig="pro-|pose">propose</reg> <lb/>
them, the god is put tenderly to bed in the trough, and the <lb/>
whole company unite in a long chaunt, led off by Kolory. This <lb/>
ended, the ceremony is over; the chiefs rise to their feet in high <lb/>
good humour, and my Lord Archbishop, after chatting awhile, <lb/>
and regaling himself with a whiff or two from a pipe of tobacco, <lb/>
tucks the canoe under his arm and marches off with it.</p>
<p>The whole of these proceedings were like those of a parcel of <lb/>
children playing with dolls and baby houses.</p>
<p>For a youngster scarcely ten inches high, and with so few early <lb/>
advantages as he doubtless had had, Moa Artua was certainly a <lb/>
precocious little fellow if he really said all that was imputed to <lb/>
him; but for what reason this poor devil of a deity, thus cuffed <lb/>
<unclear id="u2">ut,</unclear> cajoled and shut up in a box, was held in greater estima- <lb/>
<unclear id="u3"/> <unclear id="u4">an</unclear> the full-grown and dignified personages of the Taboo <lb/>
<unclear id="u5">s,</unclear> I cannot divine. And yet Mehevi, and other chiefs of <lb/>
<unclear id="u6">th</unclear> <unclear id="u7">estionable</unclear> veracity&mdash;to say nothing of the Primate himself&mdash; <lb/>
<pb n="197" entity="z000000574_0224" pid="uva-lib:244676"/>
assured me over and over again that Moa Artua was the tutelary <lb/>
deity of Typee, and was more to be held in honour than a whole <lb/>
battalion of the clumsy idols in the Hoolah Hoolah grounds. <lb/>
Kory-Kory&mdash;who seemed to have devoted considerable attention <lb/>
to the study of theology, as he knew the names of all the graven <lb/>
images in the valley, and often repeated them over to <reg orig="me&mdash;like-|wise">me&mdash;likewise</reg> <lb/>
entertained some rather enlarged ideas with regard to the <lb/>
character and pretensions of Moa Artua. He once gave me to <lb/>
understand, with a gesture there was no misconceiving, that if <lb/>
he (Moa Artua) were so minded, he could cause a cocoa-nut tree <lb/>
to sprout out of his (Kory-Kory's) head; and that it would be <lb/>
the easiest thing in life for him (Moa Artua) to take the whole <lb/>
island of Nukuheva in his mouth and dive down to the bottom <lb/>
of the sea with it.</p>
<p>But in sober seriousness, I hardly knew what to make of the <lb/>
religion of the valley. There was nothing that so much <reg orig="per-|plexed">perplexed</reg> <lb/>
the illustrious Cook, in his intercourse with the South Sea <lb/>
islanders, as their sacred rites. Although this prince of <reg orig="naviga-|tors">navigators</reg> <lb/>
was in many instances assisted by interpreters in the <reg orig="prose-|cution">prosecution</reg> <lb/>
of his researches, he still frankly acknowledges that he <lb/>
was at a loss to obtain anything like a clear insight into the <reg orig="puz-|zling">puzzling</reg> <lb/>
arcana of their faith. A similar admission has been made <lb/>
by other eminent voyagers: by Carteret, Byron, Kotzebue, and <lb/>
Vancouver.</p>
<p>For my own part, although hardly a day passed while I <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg> <lb/>
upon the island that I did not witness some religious <lb/>
ceremony or other, it was very much like seeing a parcel of <lb/>
"Freemasons" making secret signs to each other; I saw <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg>, <lb/>
but could comprehend nothing.</p>
<p>On the whole, I am inclined to believe, that the islanders in <lb/>
the Pacific have no fixed and definite ideas whatever on the <reg orig="sub-|ject">subject</reg> <lb/>
of religion. I am persuaded that Kolory himself would be <lb/>
effectually posed were he called upon to draw up the articles of <lb/>
his faith and pronounce the creed by which he hoped to be <lb/>
saved. In truth, the Typees, so far as their actions evince, <reg orig="sub-|mitted">submitted</reg> <lb/>
to no laws human or divine&mdash;always excepting the thrice <lb/>
mysterious taboo. The "independent electors" of the valley <lb/>
were not to be brow-beaten by chiefs, priests, idols, or devils. <lb/>
As for the luckless idols, they received more hard knocks than <lb/>
<pb n="198" entity="z000000574_0225" pid="uva-lib:244677"/>
supplications. I do not wonder that some of them looked so <lb/>
grim, and stood so bolt upright as if fearful of looking to the <lb/>
right or the left lest they should give any one offence. The fact <lb/>
is, they had to carry themselves "<hi rend="italic">pretty straight,</hi>" or suffer the <lb/>
consequences. Their worshippers were such a precious set of <lb/>
fickle-minded and irreverent heathens, that there was no telling <lb/>
when they might topple one of them over, break it to pieces, and <lb/>
making a fire with it on the very altar itself, fall to roasting the <lb/>
offerings of bread-fruit, and eat them in spite of its teeth.</p>
<p>In how little reverence these unfortunate deities were held by <lb/>
the natives was on one occasion most convincingly proved to <lb/>
me.&mdash;Walking with Kory-Kory through the deepest recesses of <lb/>
the groves, I perceived a curious looking image, about six feet in <lb/>
height, which originally had been placed upright against a low <lb/>
pi-pi, surmounted by a ruinous bamboo temple, but having <reg orig="be-|come">become</reg> <lb/>
fatigued and weak in the knees, was now carelessly leaning <lb/>
against it. The idol was partly concealed by the foliage of a <lb/>
tree which stood near, and whose leafy boughs drooped over the <lb/>
pile of stones, as if to protect the rude fane from the decay to <lb/>
which it was rapidly hastening. The image itself was nothing <lb/>
more than a grotesquely shaped log, carved in the likeness of a <lb/>
portly naked man with the arms clasped over the head, the jaws <lb/>
thrown wide apart, and its thick shapeless legs bowed into an <lb/>
arch. It was much decayed. The lower part was overgrown <lb/>
with a bright silky moss. Thin spears of grass sprouted from <lb/>
the distended mouth and fringed the outline of the head and <lb/>
arms. His godship had literally attained a green old age. All <lb/>
its prominent points were bruised and battered, or entirely rotted <lb/>
away. The nose had taken its departure, and from the general <lb/>
appearance of the head it might have been supposed that the <lb/>
wooden divinity, in despair at the neglect of its worshippers, had <lb/>
been trying to beat its own brains out against the surrounding trees.</p>
<p>I drew near to inspect more closely this strange object of <lb/>
idolatry; but halted reverently at the distance of two or three <lb/>
paces, out of regard to the religious prejudices of my valet. As <lb/>
soon, however, as Kory-Kory perceived that I was in one of my <lb/>
inquiring, scientific moods, to my astonishment, he sprang to the <lb/>
side of the idol, and pushing it away from the stones against <lb/>
which it rested, endeavoured to make it stand upon its legs. But <lb/>
<pb n="199" entity="z000000574_0226" pid="uva-lib:244678"/>
the divinity had lost the use of them altogether; and while <reg orig="Kory-|Kory">Kory-Kory</reg> <lb/>
was trying to prop it up, by placing a stick between it and <lb/>
the pi-pi, the monster fell clumsily to the ground, and would <lb/>
infallibly have broken its neck had not Kory-Kory providentially <lb/>
broken its fall by receiving its whole weight on his own <reg orig="half-|crushed">half-crushed</reg> <lb/>
back. I never saw the honest fellow in such a rage <lb/>
before. He leaped furiously to his feet, and seizing the stick, <lb/>
began beating the poor image: every moment or two pausing <lb/>
and talking to it in the most violent manner, as if upbraiding it <lb/>
for the accident. When his indignation had subsided a little he <lb/>
whirled the idol about most profanely, so as to give me an <reg orig="oppor-|tunity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
of examining it on all sides. I am quite sure I never <lb/>
should have presumed to have taken such liberties with the god <lb/>
myself, and I was not a little shocked at Kory-Kory's impiety.</p>
<p>This anecdote speaks for itself. When one of the inferior <lb/>
order of natives could show such contempt for a venerable and <lb/>
decrepit God of the Groves, what the state of religion must be <lb/>
among the people in general is easily to be imagined. In truth, <lb/>
I regard the Typees as a back-slidden generation. They are <lb/>
sunk in religious sloth, and require a spiritual revival. A long <lb/>
prosperity of bread-fruit and cocoa-nuts has rendered them remiss <lb/>
in the performance of their higher obligations. The wood-rot <lb/>
malady is spreading among the idols&mdash;the fruit upon their altars <lb/>
is becoming offensive&mdash;the temples themselves need re-thatching <lb/>
&mdash;the tattooed clergy are altogether too light-hearted and lazy&mdash; <lb/>
and their flocks are going astray.</p>

</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Although</hi> I had been unable during the late festival to <reg orig="ob-|tain">obtain</reg> <lb/>
information on many interesting subjects which had much <lb/>
excited my curiosity, still that important event had not passed <lb/>
by without adding materially to my general knowledge of the <lb/>
islanders.</p>
<p>I was especially struck by the physical strength and beauty <lb/>
which they displayed, by their great superiority in these respects <lb/>
over the inhabitants of the neighbouring bay of Nukuheva, and <lb/>
by the singular contrasts they presented among themselves in <lb/>
their various shades of complexion.</p>
<p>In beauty of form they surpassed anything I had ever seen. <lb/>
Not a single instance of natural deformity was observable in all <lb/>
the throng attending the revels. Occasionally I noticed among <lb/>
the men the scars of wounds they had received in battle; and <lb/>
sometimes, though very seldom, the loss of a finger, an eye, or <lb/>
an arm, attributable to the same cause. With these exceptions, <lb/>
every individual appeared free from those blemishes which <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
mar the effect of an otherwise perfect form. But their <lb/>
physical excellence did not merely consist in an exemption from <lb/>
these evils; nearly every individual of their number might have <lb/>
been taken for a sculptor's model.</p>
<p>When I remembered that these islanders derived no advantage <lb/>
from dress, but appeared in all the naked simplicity of nature, I <lb/>
could not avoid comparing them with the fine gentlemen and <lb/>
dandies who promenade such unexceptionable figures in our <reg orig="fre-|quented">frequented</reg> <lb/>
thoroughfares. Stripped of the cunning artifices of the <lb/>
<pb n="201" entity="z000000574_0228" pid="uva-lib:244680"/>
tailor, and standing forth in the garb of Eden,&mdash;what a sorry <lb/>
set of round-shouldered, spindle-shanked, crane-necked varlets <lb/>
would civilized men appear! Stuffed calves, padded breasts, <lb/>
and scientifically cut pantaloons would then avail them nothing, <lb/>
and the effect would be truly deplorable.</p>
<p>Nothing in the appearance of the islanders struck me more <lb/>
forcibly than the whiteness of their teeth. The novelist always <lb/>
compares the masticators of his heroine to ivory; but I boldly <lb/>
pronounce the teeth of the Typees to be far more beautiful than <lb/>
ivory itself. The jaws of the oldest greybeards among them <lb/>
were much better garnished than those of most of the youths of <lb/>
civilized countries; while the teeth of the young and <reg orig="middle-|aged">middle-aged</reg>, <lb/>
in their purity and whiteness, were actually dazzling to <lb/>
the eye. This marvellous whiteness of the teeth is to be <reg orig="as-|cribed">ascribed</reg> <lb/>
to the pure vegetable diet of these people, and the <reg orig="unin-|terrupted">uninterrupted</reg> <lb/>
healthfulness of their natural mode of life.</p>
<p>The men, in almost every instance, are of lofty stature, scarcely <lb/>
ever less than six feet in height, while the other sex are <reg orig="uncom-|monly">uncommonly</reg> <lb/>
diminutive. The early period of life at which the human <lb/>
form arrives at maturity in this generous tropical climate, <reg orig="like-|wise">likewise</reg> <lb/>
deserves to be mentioned. A little creature, not more than <lb/>
thirteen years of age, and who in other particulars might be <lb/>
regarded as a mere child, is often seen nursing her own baby; <lb/>
whilst lads who, under less ripening skies, would be still at <lb/>
school, are here responsible fathers of families.</p>
<p>On first entering the Typee Valley, I had been struck with <lb/>
the marked contrast presented by its inhabitants with those of <lb/>
the bay I had previously left. In the latter place, I had not <lb/>
been favourably impressed with the personal appearance of the <lb/>
male portion of the population; although with the females, <reg orig="ex-|cepting">excepting</reg> <lb/>
in some truly melancholy instances, I had been <reg orig="wonder-|fully">wonderfully</reg> <lb/>
pleased. I had observed that even the little intercourse <lb/>
Europeans had carried on with the Nukuheva natives had not <lb/>
failed to leave its traces amongst them. One of the most <reg orig="dread-|ful">dreadful</reg> <lb/>
curses under which humanity labours had commenced its <lb/>
havocks, and betrayed, as it ever does among the South Sea <lb/>
islanders, the most aggravated symptoms. From this, as from <lb/>
all other foreign inflictions, the yet uncontaminated tenants of <lb/>
the Typee Valley were wholly exempt; and long may they <lb/>
<pb n="202" entity="z000000574_0229" pid="uva-lib:244681"/>
continue so. Better will it be for them for ever to remain the <lb/>
happy and innocent heathens and barbarians that they now are, <lb/>
than, like the wretched inhabitants of the Sandwich Islands, to <lb/>
enjoy the mere name of Christians without experiencing any of <lb/>
the vital operations of true religion, whilst, at the same time, <lb/>
they are made the victims of the worst vices and evils of <reg orig="civil-|ized">civilized</reg> <lb/>
life.</p>
<p>Apart, however, from these considerations, I am inclined to <lb/>
believe that there exists a radical difference between the two <lb/>
tribes, if indeed they are not distinct races of men. To those <lb/>
who have merely touched at Nukuheva Bay, without visiting <lb/>
other portions of the island, it would hardly appear credible the <lb/>
diversities presented between the various small clans inhabiting <lb/>
so diminutive a spot. But the hereditary hostility which has <reg orig="ex-|isted">existed</reg> <lb/>
between them for ages fully accounts for this.</p>
<p>Not so easy, however, is it to assign an adequate cause for the <lb/>
endless variety of complexions to be seen in the Typee Valley. <lb/>
During the festival, I had noticed several young females whose <lb/>
skins were almost as white as any Saxon damsels; a slight dash <lb/>
of the mantling brown being all that marked the difference. <lb/>
This comparative fairness of complexion, though in a great <reg orig="de-|gree">degree</reg> <lb/>
perfectly natural, is partly the result of an artificial process, <lb/>
and of an entire exclusion from the sun. The juice of the <lb/>
"papa" root, found in great abundance at the head of the valley, <lb/>
is held in great esteem as a cosmetic, with which many of the <lb/>
females daily anoint their whole person. The habitual use of <lb/>
it whitens and beautifies the skin. Those of the young girls <lb/>
who resort to this method of heightening their charms, never <lb/>
expose themselves to the rays of the sun; an observance, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
that produces little or no inconvenience, since there are <lb/>
but few of the inhabited portions of the vale which are not <lb/>
shaded over with a spreading canopy of boughs, so that one <lb/>
may journey from house to house, scarcely deviating from the <lb/>
direct course, and yet never once see his shadow cast upon the <lb/>
ground.</p>
<p>The "papa," when used, is suffered to remain upon the skin <lb/>
for several hours; being of a light green colour, it <reg orig="conse-|quently">consequently</reg> <lb/>
imparts for the time a similar hue to the complexion. <lb/>
Nothing, therefore, can be imagined more singular than the <reg orig="ap-|pearance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="203" entity="z000000574_0230" pid="uva-lib:244682"/>
of these nearly naked damsels immediately after the <lb/>
application of the cosmetic. To look at one of them you would <lb/>
almost suppose she was some vegetable in an unripe state; and <lb/>
that, instead of living in the shade for ever, she ought to be <lb/>
placed out in the sun to ripen.</p>
<p>All the islanders are more or less in the habit of anointing <lb/>
themselves; the women preferring the "aker" or "papa," and <lb/>
the men using the oil of the cocoa-nut. Mehevi was <reg orig="re-|markably">remarkably</reg> <lb/>
fond of mollifying his entire cuticle with this <reg orig="oint-|ment">ointment</reg>. <lb/>
Sometimes he might be seen, with his whole body fairly <lb/>
reeking with the perfumed oil of the nut, looking as if he had <lb/>
just emerged from a soap-boiler's vat, or had undergone the <lb/>
process of dipping in a tallow-chandlery. To this cause perhaps, <lb/>
united to their frequent bathing and extreme cleanliness, is <reg orig="as-|cribable">ascribable</reg>, <lb/>
in a great measure, the marvellous purity and <reg orig="smooth-|ness">smoothness</reg> <lb/>
of skin exhibited by the natives in general.</p>
<p>The prevailing tint among the women of the valley was a <lb/>
light olive, and of this style of complexion Fayaway afforded <lb/>
the most beautiful example. Others were still darker, while <lb/>
not a few were of a genuine golden colour, and some of a <lb/>
swarthy hue.</p>
<p>As agreeing with much previously mentioned in this <reg orig="nar-|rative">narrative</reg>, <lb/>
I may here observe, that Mendanna, their discoverer, <lb/>
in his account of the Marquesas, described the natives as <reg orig="won-|drously">wondrously</reg> <lb/>
beautiful to behold, and as nearly resembling the <lb/>
people of southern Europe. The first of these islands seen by <lb/>
Mendanna was La Madelena, which is not far distant from <lb/>
Nukuheva; and its inhabitants in every respect resemble those <lb/>
dwelling on that and the other islands of the group. Figueroa, <lb/>
the chronicler of Mendanna's voyage, says, that on the <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg> <lb/>
the land was descried, when the Spaniards drew near the <lb/>
shore, there sallied forth, in rude procession, about seventy <lb/>
canoes, and at the same time many of the inhabitants (females, <lb/>
I presume) made towards the ships by swimming. He adds, <lb/>
that "in complexion they were nearly white; of good stature, and <lb/>
finely formed; and on their faces and bodies were delineated <lb/>
representations of fishes and other devices." The old Don then <lb/>
goes on to say, "There came, among others, two lads paddling <lb/>
their canoe, whose eyes were fixed on the ship: they had beautiful <lb/>
<pb n="204" entity="z000000574_0231" pid="uva-lib:244683"/>
faces and the most promising animation of countenance; and were <lb/>
in all things so becoming, that the pilot-mayor Quiros affirmed, <lb/>
nothing in his life ever caused him so much regret as the <reg orig="leav-|ing">leaving</reg> <lb/>
such fine creatures to be lost in that country."<ref target="n5" n="5">*</ref>

 More than <lb/>
two hundred years have gone by since the passage of which the <lb/>
above is a translation was written; and it appears to me now, <lb/>
as I read it, as fresh and true as if written but yesterday. The <lb/>
islanders are still the same; and I have seen boys in the Typee <lb/>
Valley of whose "beautiful faces" and "promising animation of <lb/>
countenance" no one who has not beheld them can form any <lb/>
adequate idea. Cook, in the account of his voyages, pronounces <lb/>
the Marquesans as by far the most splendid islanders in the <lb/>
South Seas. Stewart, the chaplain of the U. S. ship <reg orig="Vin-|cennes">Vincennes</reg>, <lb/>
in his "Scenes in the South Seas," expresses, in more <lb/>
than one place, his amazement at the surpassing loveliness of <lb/>
the women; and says that many of the Nukuheva damsels <reg orig="re-|minded">reminded</reg> <lb/>
him forcibly of the most celebrated beauties in his own <lb/>
land. Fanning, a Yankee mariner of some reputation, <reg orig="like-|wise">likewise</reg> <lb/>
records his lively impressions of the physical appearance <lb/>
of these people; and Commodore David Porter of the U. S. <lb/>
frigate Essex, is said to have been vastly smitten by the beauty <lb/>
of the ladies. Their great superiority over all other <reg orig="Polyne-|sians">Polynesians</reg> <lb/>
cannot fail to attract the notice of those who visit the <reg orig="prin-|cipal">principal</reg> <lb/>
groups in the Pacific. The voluptuous Tahitians are the <lb/>
only people who at all deserve to be compared with them; while <lb/>
the dark-hued Hawiians and the woolly-headed Feegees are <lb/>
immeasurably inferior to them. The distinguishing <reg orig="character-|istic">characteristic</reg> <lb/>
of the Marquesan islanders, and that which at once strikes <lb/>
you, is the European cast of their features&mdash;a peculiarity seldom <lb/>
observable among other uncivilized people. Many of their faces <lb/>
present a profile classically beautiful, and in the valley of Typee, <lb/>
I saw several who, like the stranger Marnoo, were in every <lb/>
respect models of beauty.</p>
<pb n="205" entity="z000000574_0232" pid="uva-lib:244684"/>
<p>Some of the natives present at the Feast of Calabashes had <lb/>
displayed a few articles of European dress; disposed, however, <lb/>
about their persons after their own peculiar fashion. Among <lb/>
these I perceived the two pieces of cotton-cloth which poor <lb/>
Toby and myself had bestowed upon our youthful guides the <lb/>
afternoon we entered the valley. They were evidently reserved <lb/>
for gala days; and during those of the festival they rendered <lb/>
the young islanders who wore them very distinguished <reg orig="charac-|ters">characters</reg>. <lb/>
The small number who were similarly adorned, and the <lb/>
great value they appeared to place upon the most common and <lb/>
most trivial articles, furnished ample evidence of the very <reg orig="re-|stricted">restricted</reg> <lb/>
intercourse they held with vessels touching at the <lb/>
island. A few cotton handkerchiefs, of a gay pattern, tied about <lb/>
the neck, and suffered to fall over the shoulders; strips of <reg orig="fan-|ciful">fanciful</reg> <lb/>
calico, swathed about the loins, were nearly all I saw.</p>
<p>Indeed, throughout the valley, there were few things of any <lb/>
kind to be seen of European origin. All I ever saw, beside the <lb/>
articles just alluded to, were the six muskets preserved in the <lb/>
Ti, and three or four similar implements of warfare hung up <lb/>
in other houses; some small canvas bags, partly filled with <lb/>
bullets and powder, and half a dozen old hatchet-heads, with <lb/>
the edges blunted and battered to such a degree as to render <lb/>
them utterly useless. These last seemed to be regarded as <lb/>
nearly worthless by the natives; and several times they held up <lb/>
one of them before me, and throwing it aside with a gesture of <lb/>
disgust, manifested their contempt for anything that could so <lb/>
soon become unserviceable.</p>
<p>But the muskets, the powder, and the bullets were held in <lb/>
most extravagant esteem. The former, from their great age <lb/>
and the peculiarities they exhibited, were well worthy a place in <lb/>
any antiquarian's armory. I remember in particular one that <lb/>
hung in the Ti, and which Mehevi&mdash;supposing as a matter of <lb/>
course that I was able to repair it&mdash;had put into my hands for <lb/>
that purpose. It was one of those clumsy, old-fashioned, <reg orig="Eng-|lish">English</reg> <lb/>
pieces known generally as Tower Hill muskets, and, for <lb/>
aught I know, might have been left on the island by Wallace, <lb/>
Carteret, Cook, or Vancouver. The stock was half rotten and <lb/>
worm-eaten; the lock was as rusty and about as well adapted <lb/>
to its ostensible purpose as an old door-hinge; the threading <lb/>
<pb n="206" entity="z000000574_0233" pid="uva-lib:244685"/>
of the screws about the trigger was completely worn away; <lb/>
while the barrel shook in the wood. Such was the weapon the <lb/>
chief desired me to restore to its original condition. As I did <lb/>
not possess the accomplishments of a gunsmith, and was <reg orig="like-|wise">likewise</reg> <lb/>
destitute of the necessary tools, I was reluctantly obliged <lb/>
to signify my inability to perform the task. At this unexpected <lb/>
communication Mehevi regarded me, for a moment, as if he <lb/>
half suspected I was some inferior sort of white man, who after <lb/>
all did not know much more than a Typee. However, after a <lb/>
most laboured explanation of the matter, I succeeded in making <lb/>
him understand the extreme difficulty of the task. Scarcely <lb/>
satisfied with my apologies, however, he marched off with the <lb/>
superannuated musket in something of a huff, as if he would no <lb/>
longer expose it to the indignity of being manipulated by such <lb/>
unskilful fingers.</p>
<p>During the festival I had not failed to remark the simplicity <lb/>
of manner, the freedom from all restraint, and, to a certain <lb/>
degree, the equality of condition manifested by the natives in <lb/>
general. No one appeared to assume any arrogant pretensions. <lb/>
There was little more than a slight difference in costume to <reg orig="dis-|tinguish">distinguish</reg> <lb/>
the chiefs from the other natives. All appeared to <lb/>
mix together freely, and without any reserve; although I noticed <lb/>
that the wishes of a chief, even when delivered in the mildest <lb/>
tone, received the same immediate obedience which elsewhere <lb/>
would have been only accorded to a peremptory command. <lb/>
What may be the extent of the authority of the chiefs over the <lb/>
rest of the tribe, I will not venture to assert; but from all I saw <lb/>
during my stay in the valley, I was induced to believe that in <lb/>
matters concerning the general welfare it was very limited. <lb/>
The required degree of deference towards them, however, was <lb/>
willingly and cheerfully yielded; and as all authority is <reg orig="trans-|mitted">transmitted</reg> <lb/>
from father to son, I have no doubt that one of the effects <lb/>
here, as elsewhere, of high birth, is to induce respect and <lb/>
obedience.</p>
<p>The civil institutions of the Marquesas Islands appear to <lb/>
be in this, as in other respects, directly the reverse of those <lb/>
of the Tahitian and Hawiian groups, where the original <lb/>
power of the king and chiefs was far more despotic than that <lb/>
of any tyrant in civilized countries. At Tahiti it used to be <lb/>
<pb n="207" entity="z000000574_0234" pid="uva-lib:244686"/>
death for one of the inferior orders to approach, without <reg orig="per-|mission">permission</reg>, <lb/>
under the shadow of the king's house; or to fail in paying <lb/>
the customary reverence when food destined for the king was <lb/>
borne past them by his messengers. At the Sandwich Islands, <lb/>
Kaahumanu, the gigantic old dowager queen&mdash;a woman of nearly <lb/>
four hundred pounds weight, and who is said to be still living at <lb/>
Mowee&mdash;was accustomed, in some of her terrific gusts of temper, <lb/>
to snatch up an ordinary sized man who had offended her, and <lb/>
snap his spine across her knee. Incredible as this may seem, it <lb/>
is a fact. While at Lahainaluna&mdash;the residence of this <reg orig="mon-|strous">monstrous</reg> <lb/>
Jezebel&mdash;a humpbacked wretch was pointed out to me, <lb/>
who, some twenty-five years previously, had had the vertebr&aelig; of <lb/>
his back-bone very seriously discomposed by his gentle mistress.</p>
<p>The particular grades of rank existing among the chiefs of <lb/>
Typee, I could not in all cases determine. Previous to the Feast <lb/>
of Calabashes I had been puzzled what particular station to assign <lb/>
to Mehevi. But the important part he took upon that occasion <lb/>
convinced me that he had no superior among the inhabitants of <lb/>
the valley. I had invariably noticed a certain degree of deference <lb/>
paid to him by all with whom I had ever seen him brought in <lb/>
contact; but when I remembered that my wanderings had been <lb/>
confined to a limited portion of the valley, and that towards the <lb/>
sea a number of distinguished chiefs resided, some of whom had <lb/>
separately visited me at Marheyo's house, and whom, until the <lb/>
Festival, I had never seen in the company of Mehevi, I felt <reg orig="dis-|posed">disposed</reg> <lb/>
to believe that his rank after all might not be particularly <lb/>
elevated.</p>
<p>The revels, however, had brought together all the warriors <lb/>
whom I had seen individually and in groups at different times <lb/>
and places. Among them Mehevi moved with an easy air of <lb/>
superiority which was not to be mistaken; and he whom I had <lb/>
only looked at as the hospitable host of the Ti, and one of the <lb/>
military leaders of the tribe, now assumed in my eyes the dignity <lb/>
of royal station. His striking costume, no less than his naturally <lb/>
commanding figure, seemed indeed to give him pre-eminence <lb/>
over the rest. The towering helmet of feathers that he wore <lb/>
raised him in height above all who surrounded him; and though <lb/>
some others were similarly adorned, the length and luxuriance of <lb/>
their plumes were far inferior to his.</p>
<pb n="208" entity="z000000574_0235" pid="uva-lib:244687"/>
<p>Mehevi was in fact the greatest of the chiefs&mdash;the head of his <lb/>
clan&mdash;the sovereign of the valley; and the simplicity of the <lb/>
social institutions of the people could not have been more <reg orig="com-|pletely">completely</reg> <lb/>
proved than by the fact, that after having been several <lb/>
weeks in the valley, and almost in daily intercourse with Mehevi, <lb/>
I should have remained until the time of the festival ignorant of <lb/>
his regal character. But a new light had now broken in upon <lb/>
me. The Ti was the palace&mdash;and Mehevi the king. Both the <lb/>
one and the other of a most simple and patriarchal nature it must <lb/>
be allowed, and wholly unattended by the ceremonious pomp <lb/>
which usually surrounds the purple.</p>
<p>After having made this discovery I could not avoid <reg orig="congratu-|lating">congratulating</reg> <lb/>
myself that Mehevi had from the first taken me as it were <lb/>
under his royal protection, and that he still continued to <reg orig="enter-|tain">entertain</reg> <lb/>
for me the warmest regard, as far at least as I was enabled <lb/>
to judge from appearances. For the future I determined to pay <lb/>
most assiduous court to him, hoping that eventually through his <lb/>
kindness I might obtain my liberty.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">King</hi> Mehevi!&mdash;A goodly sounding title!&mdash;and why should <lb/>

trivial movements of "his gracious majesty" King <reg orig="Kamme-|hammaha">Kammehammaha</reg> <lb/>
III., and "their highnesses the princes of the blood <lb/>
royal."<ref target="n6" n="6">*</ref>
<note id="n6" place="foot" n="6"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Accounts like these are sometimes copied into English and American <lb/>
journals. They lead the reader to infer that the arts and customs of <reg orig="civi-|lized">civilized</reg> <lb/>
life are rapidly refining the natives of the Sandwich Islands. But let <lb/>
no one be deceived by these accounts. The chiefs swagger about in gold <lb/>
lace and broadcloth, while the great mass of the common people are nearly <lb/>
as primitive in their appearance as in the days of Cook. In the progress of <lb/>
events at these islands, the two classes are receding from each other: the <lb/>
chiefs are daily becoming more luxurious and extravagant in their style of <lb/>
living, and the common people more and more destitute of the necessaries <lb/>
and decencies of life. But the end to which both will arrive at last will be <lb/>
the same: the one are fast destroying themselves by sensual indulgences, <lb/>
and the other are fast <hi rend="italic">being</hi> destroyed by a complication of disorders, and <lb/>
the want of wholesome food. The resources of the domineering chiefs are <lb/>
wrung from the starving serfs, and every additional bauble with which they <lb/>
bedeck themselves is purchased by the sufferings of their bondsmen; so <lb/>
that the measure of gew-gaw refinement attained by the chiefs is only an <lb/>
index to the actual state of degradation in which the greater portion of the <lb/>
population lie grovelling.</p></note>
&mdash;And who is his "gracious majesty," and what the <lb/>
quality of this "blood royal?"&mdash;His "gracious majesty" is a <lb/>
fat, lazy, negro-looking blockhead, with as little character as <lb/>
power. He has lost the noble traits of the barbarian, without <lb/>
acquiring the redeeming graces of a civilized being; and, <reg orig="al-|though">although</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="210" entity="z000000574_0237" pid="uva-lib:244689"/>
a member of the Hawiian Temperance Society, is a most <lb/>
inveterate dram-drinker.</p>
<p>The "blood royal" is an extremely thick, depraved fluid; <lb/>
formed principally of raw fish, bad brandy, and European <reg orig="sweet-|meats">sweetmeats</reg>, <lb/>
and is charged with a variety of eruptive humours, which <lb/>
are developed in sundry blotches and pimples upon the august <lb/>
face of "majesty itself," and the angelic countenances of the <lb/>
"princes and princesses of the blood-royal!"</p>
<p>Now, if the farcical puppet of a chief magistrate in the <reg orig="Sand-|wich">Sandwich</reg> <lb/>
Islands be allowed the title of King, why should it be <reg orig="with-|held">withheld</reg> <lb/>
from the noble savage Mehevi, who is a thousand times <lb/>
more worthy of the appellation? All hail, therefore, Mehevi, <lb/>
King of the Cannibal Valley, and long life and prosperity to his <lb/>
Typeean majesty! May Heaven for many a year preserve him, <lb/>
the uncompromising foe of Nukuheva and the French, if a hostile <lb/>
attitude will secure his lovely domain from the remorseless <reg orig="in-|flictions">inflictions</reg> <lb/>
of South Sea civilization.</p>
<p>Previously to seeing the Dancing Widows I had little idea <lb/>
that there were any matrimonial relations subsisting in Typee, <lb/>
and I should as soon have thought of a Platonic affection being <lb/>
cultivated between the sexes, as of the solemn connexion of man <lb/>
and wife. To be sure, there were old Marheyo and Tinor, who <lb/>
seemed to have a sort of nuptial understanding with one another; <lb/>
but for all that, I had sometimes observed a comical-looking old <lb/>
gentleman dressed in a suit of shabby tattooing, who had the <lb/>
audacity to take various liberties with the lady, and that too <lb/>
in the very presence of the old warrior her husband, who looked <lb/>
on, as good-naturedly as if nothing was happening. This <reg orig="be-|haviour">behaviour</reg>, <lb/>
until subsequent discoveries enlightened me, puzzled me <lb/>
more than anything else I witnessed in Typee.</p>
<p>As for Mehevi, I had supposed him a confirmed bachelor, as <lb/>
well as most of the principal chiefs. At any rate, if they had <lb/>
wives and families, they ought to have been ashamed of <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg>; <lb/>
for sure I am, they never troubled themselves about any <lb/>
domestic affairs. In truth, Mehevi seemed to be the president <lb/>
of a club of hearty fellows, who kept "Bachelor's Hall" in fine <lb/>
style at the Ti. I had no doubt but that they regarded children <lb/>
as odious incumbrances; and their ideas of domestic felicity were <lb/>
sufficiently shown in the fact, that they allowed no meddlesome <lb/>
<pb n="211" entity="z000000574_0238" pid="uva-lib:244690"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">P 2</fw></pb>
housekeepers to turn topsy-turvy those snug little arrangements <lb/>
they had made in their comfortable dwelling. I strongly <reg orig="sus-|pected">suspected</reg>, <lb/>
however, that some of these jolly bachelors were carrying <lb/>
on love intrigues with the maidens of the tribe; although they <lb/>
did not appear publicly to acknowledge them. I happened to <lb/>
pop upon Mehevi three or four times when he was romping&mdash;in <lb/>
a most undignified manner for a warrior king&mdash;with one of the <lb/>
prettiest little witches in the valley. She lived with an old <lb/>
woman and a young man, in a house near Marheyo's; and <reg orig="al-|though">although</reg> <lb/>
in appearance a mere child herself, had a noble boy about <lb/>
a year old, who bore a marvellous resemblance to Mehevi, whom <lb/>
I should certainly have believed to have been the father, were it <lb/>
not that the little fellow had no triangle on his face&mdash;but on <lb/>
second thoughts, tattooing is not hereditary. Mehevi, however, <lb/>
was not the only person upon whom the damsel Moonoony <lb/>
smiled&mdash;the young fellow of fifteen, who permanently resided in <lb/>
the house with her, was decidedly in her good graces. I <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
beheld both him and the chief making love at the same <lb/>
time. Is it possible, thought I, that the valiant warrior can <lb/>
consent to give up a corner in the thing he loves? This too was <lb/>
a mystery which, with others of the same kind, was afterwards <lb/>
satisfactorily explained.</p>
<p>During the second day of the Feast of Calabashes, Kory-Kory <lb/>
&mdash;being determined that I should have some understanding on <lb/>
these matters&mdash;had, in the course of his explanations, directed <lb/>
my attention to a peculiarity I had frequently remarked among <lb/>
many of the females;&mdash;principally those of a mature age and <lb/>
rather matronly appearance. This consisted in having the right <lb/>
hand and the left foot most elaborately tattooed; while the rest <lb/>
of the body was wholly free from the operation of the art, with <lb/>
the exception of the minutely dotted lips and slight marks on <lb/>
the shoulders, to which I have previously referred as comprising <lb/>
the sole tattooing exhibited by Fayaway, in common with other <lb/>
young girls of her age. The hand and foot thus embellished <lb/>
were, according to Kory-Kory, the distinguishing badge of <reg orig="wed-|lock">wedlock</reg>, <lb/>
so far as that social and highly commendable institution is <lb/>
known among these people. It answers, indeed, the same purpose <lb/>
as the plain gold ring worn by our fairer spouses.</p>
<p>After Kory-Kory's explanation of the subject, I was for some <lb/>
<pb n="212" entity="z000000574_0239" pid="uva-lib:244691"/>
time studiously respectful in the presence of all females thus <reg orig="dis-|tinguished">distinguished</reg>, <lb/>
and never ventured to indulge in the slightest <reg orig="ap-|proach">approach</reg> <lb/>
to flirtation with any of their number. Married women, <lb/>
to be sure!&mdash;I knew better than to offend them.</p>
<p>A further insight however into the peculiar domestic customs <lb/>
of the inmates of the valley did away in a measure with the <lb/>
severity of my scruples, and convinced me that I was deceived <lb/>
in some at least of my conclusions. A regular system of <reg orig="poly-|gamy">polygamy</reg> <lb/>
exists among the islanders; but of a most extraordinary <lb/>
nature,&mdash;a plurality of husbands, instead of wives; and this <reg orig="soli-|tary">solitary</reg> <lb/>
fact speaks volumes for the gentle disposition of the male <lb/>
population. Where else, indeed, could such a practice exist, even <lb/>
for a single day?&mdash;Imagine a revolution brought about in a <lb/>
Turkish seraglio, and the harem rendered the abode of bearded <lb/>
men; or conceive some beautiful woman in our own country <reg orig="run-|ning">running</reg> <lb/>
distracted at the sight of her numerous lovers murdering one <lb/>
another before her eyes, out of jealousy for the unequal <reg orig="distribu-|tion">distribution</reg> <lb/>
of her favours!&mdash;Heaven defend us from such a state of <lb/>
things!&mdash;We are scarcely amiable and forbearing enough to <lb/>
submit to it.</p>
<p>I was not able to learn what particular ceremony was observed <lb/>
in forming the marriage contract, but am inclined to think that <lb/>
it must have been of a very simple nature. Perhaps the mere <lb/>
"popping the question," as it is termed with us, might have <lb/>
been followed by an immediate nuptial alliance. At any rate, <lb/>
I have more than one reason to believe that tedious courtships <lb/>
are unknown in the valley of Typee.</p>
<p>The males considerably outnumber the females. This holds <lb/>
true of many of the islands of Polynesia, although the reverse of <lb/>
what is the case in most civilized countries. The girls are first <lb/>
wooed and won, at a very tender age, by some stripling in the <lb/>
household in which they reside. This, however, is a mere frolic <lb/>
of the affections, and no formal engagement is contracted. By <lb/>
the time this first love has a little subsided, a second suitor <reg orig="pre-|sents">presents</reg> <lb/>
himself, of graver years, and carries both boy and girl away <lb/>
to his own habitation. This disinterested and generous-hearted <lb/>
fellow now weds the young couple&mdash;marrying damsel and lover <lb/>
at the same time&mdash;and all three thenceforth live together as <lb/>
harmoniously as so many turtles. I have heard of some men <lb/>
<pb n="213" entity="z000000574_0240" pid="uva-lib:244692"/>
who in civilized countries rashly marry large families with their <lb/>
wives, but had no idea that there was any place where people <reg orig="mar-|ried">married</reg> <lb/>
supplementary husbands with them. Infidelity on either <lb/>
side is very rare. No man has more than one wife, and no wife <lb/>
of mature years has less than two husbands,&mdash;sometimes she has <lb/>
three, but such instances are not frequent. The marriage tie, <lb/>
whatever it may be, does not appear to be indissoluble; for <reg orig="sepa-|rations">separations</reg> <lb/>
occasionally happen. These, however, when they do <lb/>
take place, produce no unhappiness, and are preceded by no <lb/>
bickerings; for the simple reason, that an ill-used wife or a <reg orig="hen-|pecked">henpecked</reg> <lb/>
husband is not obliged to file a bill in Chancery to obtain <lb/>
a divorce. As nothing stands in the way of a separation, the <lb/>
matrimonial yoke sits easily and lightly, and a Typee wife lives <lb/>
on very pleasant and sociable terms with her husbands. On the <lb/>
whole wedlock, as known among these Typees, seems to be of <lb/>
a more distinct and enduring nature than is usually the case with <lb/>
barbarous people. A baneful promiscuous intercourse of the sexes <lb/>
is hereby avoided, and virtue, without being clamorously invoked, <lb/>
is, as it were, unconsciously practised.</p>
<p>The contrast exhibited between the Marquesas and other <lb/>
islanders of the Pacific in this respect, is worthy of being <lb/>
noticed. At Tahiti the marriage tie was altogether unknown; <lb/>
and the relation of husband and wife, father and son, could <lb/>
hardly be said to exist. The Arreory Society&mdash;one of the most <lb/>
singular institutions that ever existed in any part of the world&mdash; <lb/>
spread universal licentiousness over the island. It was the <reg orig="vo-|luptuous">voluptuous</reg> <lb/>
character of these people which rendered the disease <lb/>
introduced among them by De Bougainville's ships, in 1768, <lb/>
doubly destructive. It visited them like a plague, sweeping <lb/>
them off by hundreds.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the existence of wedlock among the Typees, <lb/>
the Scriptural injunction to increase and multiply seems to be <lb/>
but indifferently attended to. I never saw any of those large <lb/>
families in arithmetical or step-ladder progression which one <lb/>
often meets with at home. I never knew of more than two <lb/>
youngsters living together in the same home, and but seldom <lb/>
even that number. As for the women, it was very plain that <lb/>
the anxieties of the nursery but seldom disturbed the serenity of <lb/>
their souls; and they were never to be seen going about the <lb/>
<pb n="214" entity="z000000574_0241" pid="uva-lib:244693"/>
valley with half a score of little ones tagging at their <reg orig="apron-|strings">apronstrings</reg>, <lb/>
or rather at the bread-fruit-leaf they usually wore in <lb/>
the rear.</p>
<p>The ratio of increase among all the Polynesian nations is <lb/>
very small; and in some places as yet uncorrupted by <reg orig="inter-|course">intercourse</reg> <lb/>
with Europeans, the births would appear but very little <lb/>
to outnumber the deaths; the population in such instances <reg orig="re-|maining">remaining</reg> <lb/>
nearly the same for several successive generations, even <lb/>
upon those islands seldom or never desolated by wars, and among <lb/>
people with whom the crime of infanticide is altogether <reg orig="un-|known">unknown</reg>. <lb/>
This would seem expressly ordained by Providence to <lb/>
prevent the overstocking of the islands with a race too indolent <lb/>
to cultivate the ground, and who, for that reason alone, would, <lb/>
by any considerable increase in their numbers, be exposed to the <lb/>
most deplorable misery. During the entire period of my stay <lb/>
in the valley of Typee, I never saw more than ten or twelve <lb/>
children under the age of six months, and only became aware <lb/>
of two births.</p>
<p>It is to the absence of the marriage tie that the late rapid <lb/>
decrease of the population of the Sandwich Islands and of <lb/>
Tahiti is in part to be ascribed. The vices and diseases <reg orig="intro-|duced">introduced</reg> <lb/>
among these unhappy people annually swell the ordinary <lb/>
mortality of the islands, while, from the same cause, the <reg orig="origi-|nally">originally</reg> <lb/>
small number of births is proportionally decreased. Thus <lb/>
the progress of the Hawiians and Tahitians to utter extinction is <lb/>
accelerated in a sort of compound ratio.</p>
<p>I have before had occasion to remark that I never saw any of <lb/>
the ordinary signs of a place of sepulchre in the valley, a <reg orig="cir-|cumstance">circumstance</reg> <lb/>
which I attributed, at the time, to my living in a <lb/>
particular part of it, and being forbidden to extend my rambles <lb/>
to any considerable distance towards the sea. I have since <lb/>
thought it probable, however, that the Typees, either desirous <lb/>
of removing from their sight the evidences of mortality, or <lb/>
prompted by a taste for rural beauty, may have some charming <lb/>
cemetery situated in the shadowy recesses along the base of the <lb/>
mountains. At Nukuheva, two or three large quadrangular <lb/>
"pi-pis," heavily flagged, enclosed with regular stone walls, and <lb/>
shaded over and almost hidden from view by the interlacing <lb/>
branches of enormous trees, were pointed out to me as <reg orig="burial-|places">burial-places</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="215" entity="z000000574_0242" pid="uva-lib:244694"/>
The bodies, I understood, were deposited in rude vaults <lb/>
beneath the flagging, and were suffered to remain there without <lb/>
being disinterred. Although nothing could be more strange <lb/>
and gloomy than the aspect of these places, where the lofty <lb/>
trees threw their dark shadows over rude blocks of stone, a <lb/>
stranger in looking at them would have discerned none of the <lb/>
ordinary evidences of a place of sepulture.</p>
<p>During my stay in the valley, as none of its inmates were so <lb/>
accommodating as to die and be buried in order to gratify my <lb/>
curiosity with regard to their funeral rites, I was reluctantly <lb/>
obliged to remain in ignorance of them. As I have reason to <lb/>
believe, however, that the observances of the Typees in these <lb/>
matters are the same with those of all the other tribes on the <lb/>
island, I will here relate a scene I chanced to witness at <lb/>
Nukuheva.</p>
<p>A young man had died, about daybreak, in a house near the <lb/>
beach. I had been sent ashore that morning, and saw a good <lb/>
deal of the preparations they were making for his obsequies. <lb/>
The body, neatly wrapped in new white tappa, was laid out in <lb/>
an open shed of cocoa-nut boughs, upon a bier constructed of <lb/>
elastic bamboos ingeniously twisted together. This was <reg orig="sup-|ported">supported</reg>, <lb/>
about two feet from the ground, by large canes planted <lb/>
upright in the earth. Two females, of a dejected appearance, <lb/>
watched by its side, plaintively chanting and beating the air <lb/>
with large grass fans whitened with pipe-clay. In the <reg orig="dwelling-|house">dwelling-house</reg> <lb/>
adjoining a numerous company were assembled, and <reg orig="vari-|ous">various</reg> <lb/>
articles of food were being prepared for consumption. Two <lb/>
or three individuals, distinguished by head-dresses of beautiful <lb/>
tappa, and wearing a great number of ornaments, appeared to <lb/>
officiate as masters of the ceremonies. By noon the <reg orig="entertain-|ment">entertainment</reg> <lb/>
had fairly begun, and we were told that it would last <lb/>
during the whole of the two following days. With the <reg orig="excep-|tion">exception</reg> <lb/>
of those who mourned by the corpse, every one seemed <reg orig="dis-|posed">disposed</reg> <lb/>
to drown the sense of the late bereavement in convivial <lb/>
indulgence. The girls, decked out in their savage finery, <lb/>
danced; the old men chanted; the warriors smoked and chatted; <lb/>
and the young and lusty, of both sexes, feasted plentifully, and <lb/>
seemed to enjoy themselves as pleasantly as they could have done <lb/>
had it been a wedding.</p>
<pb n="216" entity="z000000574_0243" pid="uva-lib:244695"/>
<p>The islanders understand the art of embalming, and practise <lb/>
it with such success, that the bodies of their great chiefs are <lb/>
frequently preserved for many years in the very houses where <lb/>
they died. I saw three of these in my visit to the Bay of Tior. <lb/>
One was enveloped in immense folds of tappa, with only the face <lb/>
exposed, and hung erect against the side of the dwelling. The <lb/>
others were stretched out upon biers of bamboo, in open, <reg orig="ele-|vated">elevated</reg> <lb/>
temples, which seemed consecrated to their memory. <lb/>
The heads of enemies killed in battle are invariably preserved <lb/>
and hung up as trophies in the house of the conqueror. I <lb/>
am not acquainted with the process which is in use, but believe <lb/>
that fumigation is the principal agency employed. All the <reg orig="re-|mains">remains</reg> <lb/>
which I saw presented the appearance of a ham after <lb/>
being suspended for some time in a smoky chimney.</p>
<p>But to return from the dead to the living. The late festival <lb/>
had drawn together, as I had every reason to believe, the whole <lb/>
population of the vale, and consequently I was enabled to make <lb/>
some estimate with regard to its numbers. I should imagine <lb/>
that there were about two thousand inhabitants in Typee; and <lb/>
no number could have been better adapted to the extent of the <lb/>
valley. The valley is some nine miles in length, and may <lb/>
average one in breadth; the houses being distributed at wide <lb/>
intervals throughout its whole extent, principally, however, <reg orig="to-|wards">towards</reg> <lb/>
the head of the vale. There are no villages: the houses <lb/>
stand here and there in the shadow of the groves, or are <reg orig="scat-|tered">scattered</reg> <lb/>
along the banks of the winding stream; their <reg orig="golden-|hued">golden-hued</reg> <lb/>
bamboo sides and gleaming white thatch forming a <reg orig="beau-|tiful">beautiful</reg> <lb/>
contrast to the perpetual verdure in which they are <lb/>
embowered. There are no roads of any kind in the valley&mdash; <lb/>
nothing but a labyrinth of foot-paths twisting and turning <lb/>
among the thickets without end.</p>
<p>The penalty of the Fall presses very lightly upon the valley <lb/>
of Typee; for, with the one solitary exception of striking a <lb/>
light, I scarcely saw any piece of work performed there which <lb/>
caused the sweat to stand upon a single brow. As for digging <lb/>
and delving for a livelihood, the thing is altogether unknown. <lb/>
Nature had planted the bread-fruit and the banana, and in <lb/>
her own good time she brings them to maturity, when the idle <lb/>
savage stretches forth his hand, and satisfies his appetite.</p>
<pb n="217" entity="z000000574_0244" pid="uva-lib:244696"/>
<p>Ill-fated people! I shudder when I think of the change a few <lb/>
years will produce in their paradisaical abode; and probably when <lb/>
the most destructive vices, and the worst attendances on <reg orig="civiliza-|tion">civilization</reg>, <lb/>
shall have driven all peace and happiness from the valley, <lb/>
the magnanimous French will proclaim to the world that the <lb/>
Marquesas Islands have been converted to Christianity! and this <lb/>
the Catholic world will doubtless consider as a glorious event. <lb/>
Heaven help the "Isles of the Sea!"&mdash;The sympathy which <lb/>
Christendom feels for them has, alas! in too many instances <lb/>
proved their bane.</p>
<p>How little do some of these poor islanders comprehend when <lb/>
they look around them, that no inconsiderable part of their <reg orig="dis-|asters">disasters</reg> <lb/>
originate in certain tea-party excitements, under the <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg> <lb/>
of which benevolent-looking gentlemen in white cravats <lb/>
solicit alms, and old ladies in spectacles, and young ladies in <lb/>
sober russet low gowns, contribute sixpences towards the creation <lb/>
of a fund, the object of which is to ameliorate the spiritual <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg> <lb/>
of the Polynesians, but whose end has almost invariably <lb/>
been to accomplish their temporal destruction!</p>
<p>Let the savages be civilized, but civilize them with benefits, <lb/>
and not with evils; and let heathenism be destroyed, but not by <lb/>
destroying the heathen. The Anglo-Saxon hive have extirpated <lb/>
Paganism from the greater part of the North American <reg orig="conti-|nent">continent</reg>; <lb/>
but with it they have likewise extirpated the greater <reg orig="por-|tion">portion</reg> <lb/>
of the Red race. Civilization is gradually sweeping from <lb/>
the earth the lingering vestiges of Paganism, and at the same <lb/>
time the shrinking forms of its unhappy worshippers.</p>
<p>Among the islands of Polynesia, no sooner are the images <lb/>
overturned, the temples demolished, and the idolaters converted <lb/>
into <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> Christians, than disease, vice, and premature death <lb/>
make their appearance. The depopulated land is then recruited <lb/>
from the rapacious hordes of enlightened individuals who settle <lb/>
themselves within its borders, and clamorously announce the <lb/>
progress of the Truth. Neat villas, trim gardens, shaven lawns, <lb/>
spires, and cupolas arise, while the poor savage soon finds himself <lb/>
an interloper in the country of his fathers, and that too on the <lb/>
very site of the hut where he was born. The spontaneous fruits <lb/>
of the earth, which God in his wisdom had ordained for the <reg orig="sup-|port">support</reg> <lb/>
of the indolent natives, remorselessly seized upon and <reg orig="appro-|priated">appropriated</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="218" entity="z000000574_0245" pid="uva-lib:244697"/>
by the stranger, are devoured before the eyes of the <lb/>
starving inhabitants, or sent on board the numerous vessels which <lb/>
now touch at their shores.</p>
<p>When the famished wretches are cut off in this manner from <lb/>
their natural supplies, they are told by their benefactors to work <lb/>
and earn their support by the sweat of their brows! But to no <lb/>
fine gentleman born to hereditary opulence does manual labour <lb/>
come more unkindly than to the luxurious Indian when thus <lb/>
robbed of the bounty of Heaven. Habituated to a life of indolence, <lb/>
he cannot and will not exert himself; and want, disease, and vice, <lb/>
all evils of foreign growth, soon terminate his miserable existence.</p>
<p>But what matters all this? Behold the glorious result!&mdash;The <lb/>
abominations of Paganism have given way to the pure rites of <lb/>
the Christian worship,&mdash;the ignorant savage has been supplanted <lb/>
by the refined European! Look at Honolulu, the metropolis of <lb/>
the Sandwich Islands!&mdash;A community of disinterested merchants, <lb/>
and devoted self-exiled heralds of the Cross, located on the very <lb/>
spot that twenty years ago was defiled by the presence of idolatry. <lb/>
What a subject for an eloquent Bible-meeting orator! Nor has <lb/>
such an opportunity for a display of missionary rhetoric been <lb/>
allowed to pass by unimproved!&mdash;But when these philanthropists <lb/>
send us such glowing accounts of one half of their labours, why <lb/>
does their modesty restrain them from publishing the other half <lb/>
of the good they have wrought?&mdash;Not until I visited Honolulu <lb/>
was I aware of the fact that the small remnant of the natives had <lb/>
been civilized into draught horses, and evangelized into beasts of <lb/>
burden. But so it is. They have been literally broken into the <lb/>
traces, and are harnessed to the vehicles of their spiritual <reg orig="in-|structors">instructors</reg> <lb/>
like so many dumb brutes!</p>
<p>Among a multitude of similar exhibitions that I saw, I shall <lb/>
never forget a robust, red-faced, and very lady-like personage, a <lb/>
missionary's spouse, who day after day for months together took <lb/>
her regular airings in a little go-cart drawn by two of the <lb/>
islanders, one an old grey-headed man, and the other a rogueish <lb/>
stripling, both being, with the exception of the fig-leaf, as naked <lb/>
as when they were born. Over a level piece of ground this pair <lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">draught</hi> bipeds would go with a shambling, unsightly trot, <lb/>
the youngster hanging back all the time like a knowing horse, <lb/>
while the old hack plodded on and did all the work.</p>
<pb n="219" entity="z000000574_0246" pid="uva-lib:244698"/>
<p>Rattling along through the streets of the town in this stylish <lb/>
equipage, the lady looks about her as magnificently as any queen <lb/>
driven in state to her coronation. A sudden elevation, and a <lb/>
sandy road, however, soon disturb her serenity. The small <lb/>
wheels become imbedded in the loose soil,&mdash;the old stager stands <lb/>
tugging and sweating, while the young one frisks about and does <lb/>
nothing; not an inch does the chariot budge. Will the <reg orig="tender-|hearted">tenderhearted</reg> <lb/>
lady, who has left friends and home for the good of the <lb/>
souls of the poor heathen, will she think a little about their <lb/>
bodies and get out, and ease the wretched old man until the <lb/>
ascent is mounted? Not she; she could not dream of it. To <lb/>
be sure, she used to think nothing of driving the cows to pasture <lb/>
on the old farm in New England; but times have changed since <lb/>
then. So she retains her seat and bawls out, "Hookee! hookee!" <lb/>
(pull, pull.) The old gentleman, frightened at the sound, labours <lb/>
away harder than ever; and the younger one makes a great show <lb/>
of straining himself, but takes care to keep one eye on his <reg orig="mis-|tress">mistress</reg>, <lb/>
in order to know when to dodge out of harm's way. At <lb/>
last the good lady loses all patience; "Hookee! hookee!" and <lb/>
rap goes the heavy handle of her huge fan over the naked skull <lb/>
of the old savage; while the young one shies to one side and <lb/>
keeps beyond its range. "Hookee! hookee!" again she cries&mdash; <lb/>
"Hookee tata kannaka!" (pull strong, men,)&mdash;but all in vain, <lb/>
and she is obliged in the end to dismount and, sad necessity! <lb/>
actually to walk to the top of the hill.</p>
<p>At the town where this paragon of humility resides, is a <lb/>
spacious and elegant American chapel, where divine service is <lb/>
regularly performed. Twice every Sabbath towards the close of <lb/>
the exercises may be seen a score or two of little waggons ranged <lb/>
along the railing in front of the edifice, with two squalid native <lb/>
footmen in the livery of nakedness standing by each, and waiting <lb/>
for the dismission of the congregation to draw their superiors <lb/>
home.</p>
<p>Lest the slightest misconception should arise from anything <lb/>
thrown out in this chapter, or indeed in any other part of the <lb/>
volume, let me here observe, that against the cause of missions <lb/>
in the abstract no Christian can possibly be opposed: it is in <lb/>
truth a just and holy cause. But if the great end proposed by <lb/>
it be spiritual, the agency employed to accomplish that end is <lb/>
<pb n="220" entity="z000000574_0247" pid="uva-lib:244699"/>
purely earthly; and, although the object in view be the <reg orig="achieve-|ment">achievement</reg> <lb/>
of much good, that agency may nevertheless be productive <lb/>
of evil. In short, missionary undertaking, however it may be <lb/>
blessed of Heaven, is in itself but human; and subject, like <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg> <lb/>
else, to errors and abuses. And have not errors and abuses <lb/>
crept into the most sacred places, and may there not be unworthy <lb/>
or incapable missionaries abroad, as well as ecclesiastics of a <lb/>
similar character at home? May not the unworthiness or <reg orig="in-|capacity">incapacity</reg> <lb/>
of those who assume apostolic functions upon the remote <lb/>
islands of the sea more easily escape detection by the world at <lb/>
large than if it were displayed in the heart of a city? An <reg orig="un-|warranted">unwarranted</reg> <lb/>
confidence in the sanctity of its apostles&mdash;a proneness <lb/>
to regard them as incapable of guile&mdash;and an impatience of the <lb/>
least suspicion as to their rectitude as men or Christians, have <lb/>
ever been prevailing faults in the Church. Nor is this to be <lb/>
wondered at: for subject as Christianity is to the assaults of <reg orig="un-|principled">unprincipled</reg> <lb/>
foes, we are naturally disposed to regard everything <lb/>
like an exposure of ecclesiastical misconduct as the offspring of <lb/>
malevolence or irreligious feeling. Not even this last <reg orig="considera-|tion">consideration</reg>, <lb/>
however, shall deter me from the honest expression of my <lb/>
sentiments.</p>
<p>There is something decidedly wrong in the practical operations <lb/>
of the Sandwich Island Missions. Those who from pure <reg orig="re-|ligious">religious</reg> <lb/>
motives contribute to the support of this enterprise, <lb/>
should take care to ascertain that their donations, flowing through <lb/>
many devious channels, at last effect their legitimate object, <lb/>
the conversion of the Hawiians. I urge this not because I doubt <lb/>
the moral probity of those who disburse these funds, but because <lb/>
I know that they are not rightly applied. To read pathetic <lb/>
accounts of missionary hardships, and glowing descriptions of <lb/>
conversions, and baptisms taking place beneath palm-trees, is one <lb/>
thing; and to go to the Sandwich Islands and see the missionaries <lb/>
dwelling in picturesque and prettily-furnished coral-rock villas, <lb/>
whilst the miserable natives are committing all sorts of <reg orig="immorali-|ties">immoralities</reg> <lb/>
around them, is quite another.</p>
<p>In justice to the missionaries, however, I will willingly admit, <lb/>
that whatever evils may have resulted from their collective <reg orig="mis-|management">mismanagement</reg> <lb/>
of the business of the mission, and from the want of <lb/>
vital piety evinced by some of their number, still the present <lb/>
<pb n="221" entity="z000000574_0248" pid="uva-lib:244700"/>
deplorable condition of the Sandwich Islands is by no means <lb/>
wholly chargeable against them. The demoralising influence of <lb/>
a dissolute foreign population, and the frequent visits of all <reg orig="de-|scriptions">descriptions</reg> <lb/>
of vessels, have tended not a little to increase the evils <lb/>
alluded to. In a word, here, as in every case where Civilization <lb/>
has in any way been introduced among those whom we call <reg orig="sa-|vages">savages</reg>, <lb/>
she has scattered her vices, and withheld her blessings.</p>
<p>As wise a man as Shakspeare has said, that the bearer of evil <lb/>
tidings hath but a losing office; and so I suppose will it prove with <lb/>
me, in communicating to the trusting friends of the Hawiian <lb/>
Mission what has been disclosed in various portions of this <reg orig="nar-|rative">narrative</reg>. <lb/>
I am persuaded, however, that as these disclosures will <lb/>
by their very nature attract attention, so they will lead to <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
which will not be without ultimate benefit to the cause of <lb/>
Christianity in the Sandwich Islands.</p>
<p>I have but one thing more to add in connection with this <reg orig="sub-|ject&mdash;those">subject&mdash;those</reg> <lb/>
things which I have stated as facts will remain facts, <lb/>
in spite of whatever the bigoted or incredulous may say or write <lb/>
against them. My reflections, however, on those facts may not <lb/>
be free from error. If such be the case, I claim no further <reg orig="in-|dulgence">indulgence</reg> <lb/>
than should be conceded to every man whose object is <lb/>
to do good.</p>

<p rend="center">The social Condition and general Character of the Typees.</p>
</argument>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I have</hi> already mentioned that the influence exerted over the <lb/>
people of the valley by their chiefs was mild in the extreme: <lb/>
and as to any general rule or standard of conduct by which the <lb/>
commonalty were governed in their intercourse with each other, <lb/>
so far as my observation extended, I should be almost tempted <lb/>
to say that none existed on the island, except, indeed, the <reg orig="mys-|terious">mysterious</reg> <lb/>
"Taboo" be considered as such. During the time I <lb/>
lived among the Typees, no one was ever put upon his trial for <lb/>
any offence against the public. To all appearances there were <lb/>
no courts of law or equity. There was no municipal police for <lb/>
the purpose of apprehending vagrants and disorderly characters. <lb/>
In short, there were no legal provisions whatever for the <reg orig="well-|being">wellbeing</reg> <lb/>
and conservation of society, the enlightened end of <reg orig="civil-|ized">civilized</reg> <lb/>
legislation. And yet everything went on in the valley <lb/>
with a harmony and smoothness unparalleled, I will venture to <lb/>
assert, in the most select, refined, and pious associations of <lb/>
mortals in Christendom. How are we to explain this enigma? <lb/>
These islanders were heathens! savages! ay, cannibals! and <lb/>
how came they, without the aid of established law, to exhibit, in <lb/>
so eminent a degree, that social order which is the greatest <lb/>
blessing and highest pride of the social state?</p>
<p>It may reasonably be inquired, how were these people <reg orig="go-|verned">governed</reg>? <lb/>
how were their passions controlled in their everyday <lb/>
transactions? It must have been by an inherent principle of <lb/>
honesty and charity towards each other. They seemed to be <lb/>
governed by that sort of tacit common-sense law which, say <lb/>
what they will of the inborn lawlessness of the human race, <lb/>
has its precepts graven on every breast. The grand principles <lb/>
of virtue and honour, however they may be distorted by <reg orig="arbi-|trary">arbitrary</reg> <lb/>
codes, are the same all the world over: and where these <lb/>
<pb n="223" entity="z000000574_0250" pid="uva-lib:244702"/>
principles are concerned, the right or wrong of any action <lb/>
appears the same to the uncultivated as to the enlightened <lb/>
mind. It is to this indwelling, this universally diffused <reg orig="percep-|tion">perception</reg> <lb/>
of what is <hi rend="italic">just</hi> and <hi rend="italic">noble,</hi> that the integrity of the <reg orig="Mar-|quesans">Marquesans</reg> <lb/>
in their intercourse with each other is to be attributed. <lb/>
In the darkest nights they slept securely, with all their worldly <lb/>
wealth around them, in houses the doors of which were never <lb/>
fastened. The disquieting ideas of theft or assassination never <lb/>
disturbed them. Each islander reposed beneath his own <reg orig="pal-|metto">palmetto</reg> <lb/>
thatching, or sat under his own bread-fruit-tree, with none <lb/>
to molest or alarm him. There was not a padlock in the valley, <lb/>
nor anything that answered the purpose of one: still there was <lb/>
no community of goods. This long spear, so elegantly carved <lb/>
and highly polished, belongs to Wormoonoo: it is far <reg orig="hand-|somer">handsomer</reg> <lb/>
than the one which old Marheyo so greatly prizes; it <lb/>
is the most valuable article belonging to its owner. And yet <lb/>
I have seen it leaning against a cocoa-nut tree in the grove, and <lb/>
there it was found when sought for. Here is a sperm-whale <lb/>
tooth, graven all over with cunning devices: it is the property <lb/>
of Karluna: it is the most precious of the damsel's ornaments. <lb/>
In her estimation its price is far above rubies&mdash;and yet there <lb/>
hangs the dental jewel by its cord of braided bark, in the girl's <lb/>
house, which is far back in the valley; the door is left open, <lb/>
and all the inmates have gone off to bathe in the stream.<ref target="n7" n="7">*</ref>
<note id="n7" place="foot" n="7"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>The strict honesty which the inhabitants of nearly all the Polynesian <lb/>
Islands manifest towards each other, is in striking contrast with the thieving <lb/>
propensities some of them evince in their intercourse with foreigners. It <lb/>
would almost seem that, according to their peculiar code of morals, the <reg orig="pil-|fering">pilfering</reg> <lb/>
of a hatchet or a wrought nail from a European is looked upon as <lb/>
a praiseworthy action. Or rather, it may be presumed, that bearing in <lb/>
mind the wholesale forays made upon them by their nautical visitors, they <lb/>
consider the property of the latter as a fair object of reprisal. This <reg orig="con-|sideration">consideration</reg>, <lb/>
while it serves to reconcile an apparent contradiction in the <lb/>
moral character of the islanders, should in some measure alter that low <lb/>
opinion of it which the reader of South Sea voyages is too apt to form.</p></note>
</p>
<p>So much for the respect in which "personal property" is <lb/>
held in Typee; how secure an investment of "real property" <lb/>
may be, I cannot take upon me to say. Whether the land <lb/>
of the valley was the joint property of its inhabitants, or <lb/>
whether it was parcelled out among a certain number of landed <lb/>
proprietors who allowed everybody to "squat" and "poach" <lb/>
<pb n="224" entity="z000000574_0251" pid="uva-lib:244703"/>
as much as he or she pleased, I never could ascertain. At any <lb/>
rate, musty parchments and title deeds there were none on the <lb/>
island; and I am half inclined to believe that its inhabitants <lb/>
hold their broad valleys in fee simple from Nature herself; to <lb/>
have and to hold, so long as grass grows and water runs; or <lb/>
until their French visitors, by a summary mode of <reg orig="conveyanc-|ing">conveyancing</reg>, <lb/>
shall appropriate them to their own benefit and behoof.</p>
<p>Yesterday I saw Kory-Kory hie him away, armed with a <lb/>
long pole, with which, standing on the ground, he knocked <lb/>
down the fruit from the topmost boughs of the trees, and <lb/>
brought them home in his basket of cocoa-nut leaves. To-day <lb/>
I see an islander, whom I know to reside in a distant part of <lb/>
the valley, doing the self-same thing. On the sloping bank of <lb/>
the stream are a number of banana-trees. I have often seen a <lb/>
score or two of young people making a merry foray on the great <lb/>
golden clusters, and bearing them off, one after another, to <lb/>
different parts of the vale, shouting and tramping as they went. <lb/>
No churlish old curmudgeon could have been the owner of that <lb/>
grove of bread-fruit trees, or of these gloriously yellow bunches <lb/>
of bananas.</p>
<p>From what I have said it will be perceived that there is a <lb/>
vast difference between "personal property" and "real estate" <lb/>
in the valley of Typee. Some individuals, of course, are more <lb/>
wealthy than others. For example: the ridge-pole of <reg orig="Mar-|heyo's">Marheyo's</reg> <lb/>
house bends under the weight of many a huge package <lb/>
of tappa; his long couch is laid with mats placed one upon the <lb/>
other seven deep. Outside, Tinor has ranged along in her <lb/>
bamboo cupboard&mdash;or whatever the place may be called&mdash;a <lb/>
goodly array of calabashes and wooden trenchers. Now, the house <lb/>
just beyond the grove, and next to Marheyo's, occupied by <reg orig="Ru-|aruga">Ruaruga</reg>, <lb/>
is not quite so well furnished. There are only three <lb/>
moderate-sized packages swinging overhead: there are only <lb/>
two layers of mats beneath, and the calabashes and trenchers are <lb/>
not so numerous, nor so tastefully stained and carved. But then, <lb/>
Ruaruga has a house&mdash;not so pretty a one, to be sure&mdash;but just <lb/>
as commodious as Marheyo's; and, I suppose, if he wished to vie <lb/>
with his neighbour's establishment, he could do so with very <lb/>
little trouble. These, in short, constituted the chief differences <lb/>
perceivable in the relative wealth of the people in Typee.</p>

<p>Civilization does not engross all the virtues of humanity: she <lb/>
has not even her full share of them. They flourish in greater <lb/>
abundance and attain greater strength among many barbarous <lb/>
people. The hospitality of the wild Arab, the courage of the <lb/>
North American Indian, and the faithful friendships of some of the <lb/>
Polynesian nations, far surpass any thing of a similar kind among <lb/>
the polished communities of Europe. If truth and justice, and <lb/>
the better principles of our nature, cannot exist unless enforced <lb/>
by the statute-book, how are we to account for the social <reg orig="condi-|tion">condition</reg> <lb/>
of the Typees? So pure and upright were they in all the <lb/>
relations of life, that entering their valley, as I did, under the <lb/>
most erroneous impressions of their character, I was soon led to <lb/>
exclaim in amazement: "Are these the ferocious savages, the <lb/>
blood-thirsty cannibals of whom I have heard such frightful <lb/>
tales! They deal more kindly with each other, and are more <lb/>
humane, than many who study essays on virtue and benevolence, <lb/>
and who repeat every night that beautiful prayer breathed first <lb/>
by the lips of the divine and gentle Jesus." I will frankly <reg orig="de-|clare">declare</reg>, <lb/>
that after passing a few weeks in this valley of the <reg orig="Mar-|quesas">Marquesas</reg>, <lb/>
I formed a higher estimate of human nature than I had <lb/>
ever before entertained. But alas! since then I have been one <lb/>
of the crew of a man-of war, and the pent-up wickedness of five <lb/>
hundred men has nearly overturned all my previous theories.</p>
<p>There was one admirable trait in the general character of the <lb/>
Typees which, more than any thing else, secured my admiration: <lb/>
it was the unanimity of feeling they displayed on every occasion. <lb/>
With them there hardly appeared to be any difference of opinion <lb/>
upon any subject whatever. They all thought and acted alike. <lb/>
I do not conceive that they could support a debating society for <lb/>
a single night: there would be nothing to dispute about; and <lb/>
were they to call a convention to take into consideration the state <lb/>
of the tribe, its session would be a remarkably short one. They <lb/>
showed this spirit of unanimity in every action of life: every <lb/>
thing was done in concert and good fellowship. I will give an <lb/>
instance of this fraternal feeling.</p>
<p>One day, in returning with Kory-Kory from my accustomed <lb/>
visit to the Ti, we passed by a little opening in the grove; on <lb/>
one side of which, my attendant informed me, was that afternoon <lb/>
to be built a dwelling of bamboo. At least a hundred of the <lb/>
<pb n="226" entity="z000000574_0253" pid="uva-lib:244705"/>
natives were bringing materials to the ground, some carrying <lb/>
in their hands one or two of the canes which were to form the <lb/>
sides, others slender rods of the habiscus, strung with palmetto <lb/>
leaves, for the roof. Every one contributed something to the <lb/>
work; and by the united, but easy, and even indolent, labours of <lb/>
all, the entire work was completed before sunset. The islanders, <lb/>
while employed in erecting this tenement, reminded me of a <lb/>
colony of beavers at work. To be sure, they were hardly as <lb/>
silent and demure as those wonderful creatures, nor were they <lb/>
by any means as diligent. To tell the truth, they were <reg orig="some-|what">somewhat</reg> <lb/>
inclined to be lazy, but a perfect tumult of hilarity <reg orig="pre-|vailed">prevailed</reg>; <lb/>
and they worked together so unitedly, and seemed <reg orig="ac-|tuated">actuated</reg> <lb/>
by such an instinct of friendliness, that it was truly <reg orig="beau-|tiful">beautiful</reg> <lb/>
to behold.</p>
<p>Not a single female took part in this employment: and if the <lb/>
degree of consideration in which the ever-adorable sex is held by <lb/>
the men be&mdash;as the philosophers affirm&mdash;a just criterion of the <lb/>
degree of refinement among a people, then I may truly pronounce <lb/>
the Typees to be as polished a community as ever the sun shone <lb/>
upon. The religious restrictions of the taboo alone excepted, <lb/>
the women of the valley were allowed every possible indulgence. <lb/>
Nowhere are the ladies more assiduously courted; nowhere are <lb/>
they better appreciated as the contributors to our highest <reg orig="enjoy-|ments">enjoyments</reg>; <lb/>
and nowhere are they more sensible of their power. Far <lb/>
different from their condition among many rude nations, where <lb/>
the women are made to perform all the work while their <reg orig="ungal-|lant">ungallant</reg> <lb/>
lords and masters lie buried in sloth, the gentle sex in the <lb/>
valley of Typee were exempt from toil, if toil it might be called <lb/>
that, even in that tropical climate, never distilled one drop of <lb/>
perspiration. Their light household occupations, together with <lb/>
the manufacture of tappa, the platting of mats, and the polishing <lb/>
of drinking-vessels, were the only employments pertaining to <lb/>
the women. And even these resembled those pleasant avocations <lb/>
which fill up the elegant morning leisure of our fashionable <lb/>
ladies at home. But in these occupations, slight and agreeable <lb/>
though they were, the giddy young girls very seldom engaged. <lb/>
Indeed these wilful, care-killing damsels were averse to all useful <lb/>
employment. Like so many spoiled beauties, they ranged through <lb/>
the groves&mdash;bathed in the stream&mdash;danced&mdash;flirted&mdash;played all <lb/>
<pb n="227" entity="z000000574_0254" pid="uva-lib:244706"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">Q 2</fw></pb>
manner of mischievous pranks, and passed their days in one <lb/>
merry round of thoughtless happiness.</p>
<p>During my whole stay on the island I never witnessed a single <lb/>
quarrel, nor any thing that in the slightest degree approached <lb/>
even to a dispute. The natives appeared to form one household, <lb/>
whose members were bound together by the ties of strong <reg orig="affec-|tion">affection</reg>. <lb/>
The love of kindred I did not so much perceive, for it <lb/>
seemed blended in the general love; and where all were treated <lb/>
as brothers and sisters, it was hard to tell who were actually <reg orig="re-|lated">related</reg> <lb/>
to each other by blood.</p>
<p>Let it not be supposed that I have overdrawn this picture. I <lb/>
have not done so. Nor let it be urged, that the hostility of this tribe <lb/>
to foreigners, and the hereditary feuds they carry on against <lb/>
their fellow-islanders beyond the mountains, are facts which <reg orig="con-|tradict">contradict</reg> <lb/>
me. Not so: these apparent discrepancies are easily <lb/>
reconciled. By many a legendary tale of violence and wrong, <lb/>
as well as by events which have passed before their eyes, these <lb/>
people have been taught to look upon white men with <reg orig="abhor-|rence">abhorrence</reg>. <lb/>
The cruel invasion of their country by Porter has alone <lb/>
furnished them with ample provocation; and I can sympathize <lb/>
in the spirit which prompts the Typee warrior to guard all the <lb/>
passes to his valley with the point of his levelled spear, and, <lb/>
standing upon the beach, with his back turned upon his green <lb/>
home, to hold at bay the intruding European.</p>
<p>As to the origin of the enmity of this particular clan towards <lb/>
the neighbouring tribes, I cannot so confidently speak. I will <lb/>
not say that their foes are the aggressors, nor will I endeavour <lb/>
to palliate their conduct. But surely, if our evil passions must <lb/>
find vent, it is far better to expend them on strangers and aliens, <lb/>
than in the bosom of the community in which we dwell. In <lb/>
many polished countries civil contentions, as well as domestic <lb/>
enmities, are prevalent, at the same time that the most atrocious <lb/>
foreign wars are waged. How much less guilty, then, are our <lb/>
islanders, who of these three sins are only chargeable with one, <lb/>
and that the least criminal!</p>
<p>The reader will ere long have reason to suspect that the <reg orig="Ty-|pees">Typees</reg> <lb/>
are not free from the guilt of cannibalism; and he will <lb/>
then, perhaps, charge me with admiring a people against whom <lb/>
so odious a crime is chargeable. But this only enormity in their <lb/>
<pb n="228" entity="z000000574_0255" pid="uva-lib:244707"/>
character is not half so horrible as it is usually described. <reg orig="Ac-|cording">According</reg> <lb/>
to the popular fictions, the crews of vessels, shipwrecked <lb/>
on some barbarous coast, are eaten alive like so many dainty joints <lb/>
by the uncivil inhabitants; and unfortunate voyagers are lured <lb/>
into smiling and treacherous bays; knocked in the head with <lb/>
outlandish war-clubs; and served up without any preliminary <lb/>
dressing. In truth, so horrific and improbable are these accounts, <lb/>
that many sensible and well-informed people will not believe <lb/>
that any cannibals exist; and place every book of voyages which <lb/>
purports to give any account of them, on the same shelf with <lb/>
Blue Beard and Jack the Giant-Killer; while others, implicitly <lb/>
crediting the most extravagant fictions, firmly believe that there <lb/>
are people in the world with tastes so depraved that they would <lb/>
infinitely prefer a single mouthful of material humanity to a <lb/>
good dinner of roast beef and plum pudding. But here, Truth, <lb/>
who loves to be centrally located, is again found between the two <lb/>
extremes; for cannibalism to a certain moderate extent is <reg orig="prac-|tised">practised</reg> <lb/>
among several of the primitive tribes in the Pacific, but it <lb/>
is upon the bodies of slain enemies alone; and horrible and <reg orig="fear-|ful">fearful</reg> <lb/>
as the custom is, immeasurably as it is to be abhorred and <lb/>
condemned, still I assert that those who indulge in it are in <lb/>
other respects humane and virtuous.</p>

<p rend="center">Fishing Parties&mdash;Mode of distributing the Fish&mdash;Midnight Banquet&mdash; <lb/>
Timekeeping Tapers&mdash;Unceremonious style of eating the Fish.</p>
</argument>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">There</hi> was no instance in which the social and kindly <reg orig="disposi-|tions">dispositions</reg> <lb/>
of the Typees were more forcibly evinced than in the <reg orig="man-|ner">manner</reg> <lb/>
they conducted their great fishing parties. Four times during <lb/>
my stay in the valley the young men assembled near the full of <lb/>
the moon, and went together on these excursions. As they were <lb/>
generally absent about forty-eight hours, I was led to believe that <lb/>
they went out towards the open sea, some distance from the bay. <lb/>
The Polynesians seldom use a hook and line, almost always <reg orig="em-|ploying">employing</reg> <lb/>
large well-made nets, most ingeniously fabricated from <lb/>
the twisted fibres of a certain bark. I examined several of them <lb/>
which had been spread to dry upon the beach at Nukuheva. <lb/>
They resemble very much our own seines, and I should think <lb/>
were very nearly as durable.</p>
<p>All the South Sea Islanders are passionately fond of fish; but <lb/>
none of them can be more so than the inhabitants of Typee. I <lb/>
could not comprehend, therefore, why they so seldom sought it <lb/>
in their waters, for it was only at stated times that the fishing <lb/>
parties were formed, and these occasions were always looked <lb/>
forward to with no small degree of interest.</p>
<p>During their absence the whole population of the place were <lb/>
in a ferment, and nothing was talked of but "pehee, pehee" <lb/>
(fish, fish). Towards the time when they were expected to <reg orig="re-|turn">return</reg> <lb/>
the vocal telegraph was put into operation&mdash;the inhabitants, <lb/>
who were scattered throughout the length of the valley, leaped <lb/>
upon rocks and into trees, shouting with delight at the thoughts of <lb/>
the anticipated treat. As soon as the approach of the party was <lb/>
announced, there was a general rush of the men towards the <lb/>
beach; some of them remaining, however, about the Ti, in order <lb/>
to get matters in readiness for the reception of the fish, which <lb/>
<pb n="230" entity="z000000574_0257" pid="uva-lib:244709"/>
were brought to the Taboo groves in immense packages of <lb/>
leaves, each one of them being suspended from a pole carried on <lb/>
the shoulders of two men.</p>
<p>I was present at the Ti on one of these occasions, and the sight <lb/>
was most interesting. After all the packages had arrived, they <lb/>
were laid in a row under the verandah of the building and <lb/>
opened. The fish were all quite small, generally about the size <lb/>
of a herring, and of every variety of colour. About one-eighth <lb/>
of the whole being reserved for the use of the Ti itself, the <reg orig="re-|mainder">remainder</reg> <lb/>
was divided into numerous smaller packages, which were <lb/>
immediately dispatched in every direction to the remotest parts <lb/>
of the valley. Arrived at their destination, these were in turn <lb/>
portioned out, and equally distributed among the various houses <lb/>
of each particular district. The fish were under a strict Taboo, <lb/>
until the distribution was completed, which seemed to be effected <lb/>
in the most impartial manner. By the operation of this system <lb/>
every man, woman, and child in the vale were at one and the <lb/>
same time partaking of this favourite article of food.</p>
<p>Once I remember the party arrived at midnight; but the <reg orig="un-|seasonableness">unseasonableness</reg> <lb/>
of the hour did not repress the impatience of the <lb/>
islanders. The carriers dispatched from the Ti were to be seen <lb/>
hurrying in all directions through the deep groves; each <reg orig="indivi-|dual">individual</reg> <lb/>
preceded by a boy bearing a flaming torch of dried <reg orig="cocoa-|nut">cocoanut</reg> <lb/>
boughs, which from time to time was replenished from the <lb/>
materials scattered along the path. The wild glare of these <lb/>
enormous flambeaux, lighting up with a startling brilliancy the <lb/>
innermost recesses of the vale, and seen moving rapidly along <lb/>
beneath the canopy of leaves, the savage shout of the excited <reg orig="mes-|sengers">messengers</reg> <lb/>
sounding the news of their approach, which was answered <lb/>
on all sides, and the strange appearance of their naked bodies, <lb/>
seen against the gloomy background, produced altogether an <lb/>
effect upon my mind that I shall long remember.</p>
<p>It was on this same occasion that Kory-Kory awakened me at the <lb/>
dead hour of night, and in a sort of transport communicated the <lb/>
intelligence contained in the words "pehee perni" (fish come). <lb/>
As I happened to have been in a remarkably sound and refreshing <lb/>
slumber, I could not imagine why the information had not been <lb/>
deferred until morning; indeed, I felt very much inclined to fly <lb/>
into a passion and box my valet's ears; but on second thoughts <lb/>
<pb n="231" entity="z000000574_0258" pid="uva-lib:244710"/>
I got quietly up, and on going outside the house was not a little <lb/>
interested by the moving illumination which I beheld.</p>
<p>When old Marheyo received his share of the spoils, immediate <lb/>
preparations were made for a midnight banquet; calabashes of <lb/>
poee-poee were filled to the brim; green bread-fruit were roasted; <lb/>
and a huge cake of "amar" was cut up with a sliver of bamboo <lb/>
and laid out on an immense banana-leaf.</p>
<p>At this supper we were lighted by several of the native tapers, <lb/>
held in the hands of young girls. These tapers are most <reg orig="inge-|niously">ingeniously</reg> <lb/>
made. There is a nut abounding in the valley, called <lb/>
by the Typees "armor," closely resembling our common <reg orig="horse-|chestnut">horse-chestnut</reg>. <lb/>
The shell is broken, and the contents extracted whole. <lb/>
Any number of these are strung at pleasure upon the long elastic <lb/>
fibre that traverses the branches of the cocoa-nut tree. Some of <lb/>
these tapers are eight and ten feet in length; but being perfectly <lb/>
flexible, one end is held in a coil, while the other is lighted. The <lb/>
nut burns with a fitful bluish flame, and the oil that it contains is <lb/>
exhausted in about ten minutes. As one burns down, the next <lb/>
becomes ignited, and the ashes of the former are knocked into a <lb/>
cocoa-nut shell kept for the purpose. This primitive candle <reg orig="re-|quires">requires</reg> <lb/>
continual attention, and must be constantly held in the <lb/>
hand. The person so employed marks the lapse of time by the <lb/>
number of nuts consumed, which is easily learned by counting <lb/>
the bits of tappa distributed at regular intervals along the <lb/>
string.</p>
<p>I grieve to state so distressing a fact, but the inhabitants of <lb/>
Typee were in the habit of devouring fish much in the same way <lb/>
that a civilized being would eat a radish, and without any more <lb/>
previous preparation. They eat it raw; scales, bones, gills, and <lb/>
all the inside. The fish is held by the tail, and the head being <lb/>
introduced into the mouth, the animal disappears with a rapidity <lb/>
that would at first nearly lead one to imagine it had been launched <lb/>
bodily down the throat.</p>
<p>Raw fish! Shall I ever forget my sensations when I first saw <lb/>
my island beauty devour one? Oh, heavens! Fayaway, how <lb/>
could you ever have contracted so vile a habit? However, after <lb/>
the first shock had subsided, the custom grew less odious in my <lb/>
eyes, and I soon accustomed myself to the sight. Let no one <lb/>
imagine, however, that the lovely Fayaway was in the habit of <lb/>
<pb n="232" entity="z000000574_0259" pid="uva-lib:244711"/>
swallowing great vulgar-looking fishes: oh, no; with her <reg orig="beau-|tiful">beautiful</reg> <lb/>
small hand she would clasp a delicate, little, golden-hued <lb/>
love of a fish, and eat it as elegantly and as innocently as though <lb/>
it were a Naples biscuit. But, alas! it was after all a raw fish; <lb/>
and all I can say is, that Fayaway ate it in a more ladylike manner <lb/>
than any other girl of the valley.</p>
<p>When at Rome do as the Romans do, I held to be so good a <lb/>
proverb, that being in Typee I made a point of doing as the <lb/>
Typees did. Thus I ate poee-poee as they did; I walked about <lb/>
in a garb striking for its simplicity; and I reposed on a <reg orig="commu-|nity">community</reg> <lb/>
of couches; besides doing many other things in conformity <lb/>
with their peculiar habits; but the farthest I ever went in the way <lb/>
of conformity, was on several occasions to regale myself with <lb/>
raw fish. These being remarkably tender, and quite small, the <lb/>
undertaking was not so disagreeable in the main, and after a few <lb/>
trials I positively began to relish them: however, I subjected <lb/>
them to a slight operation with my knife previously to making <lb/>
my repast.</p>

</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I think</hi> I must enlighten the reader a little about the natural <lb/>
history of the valley.</p>
<p>Whence, in the name of Count Buffon and Baron Cuvier, <lb/>
came those dogs that I saw in Typee? Dogs!&mdash;Big hairless <lb/>
rats rather; all with smooth, shining, speckled hides&mdash;fat sides, <lb/>
and very disagreeable faces. Whence could they have come? <lb/>
That they were not the indigenous production of the region, I <lb/>
am firmly convinced. Indeed they seemed aware of their being <lb/>
interlopers, looking fairly ashamed, and always trying to hide <lb/>
themselves in some dark corner. It was plain enough they did <lb/>
not feel at home in the vale&mdash;that they wished themselves well <lb/>
out of it, and back to the ugly country from which they must <lb/>
have come.</p>
<p>Scurvy curs! they were my abhorrence; I should have liked <lb/>
nothing better than to have been the death of every one of them. <lb/>
In fact, on one occasion, I intimated the propriety of a canine <lb/>
crusade to Mehevi; but the benevolent king would not consent <lb/>
to it. He heard me very patiently; but when I had finished, <lb/>
shook his head, and told me, in confidence, that they were <lb/>
"taboo."</p>
<p>As for the animal that made the fortune of the ex-lord-mayor <lb/>
Whittington: I shall never forget the day that I was lying in <lb/>
the house about noon, everybody else being fast asleep; and <lb/>
happening to raise my eyes, met those of a big black spectral cat, <lb/>
which sat erect in the doorway, looking at me with its frightful <lb/>
goggling green orbs, like one of those monstrous imps that <reg orig="tor-|ment">torment</reg> <lb/>
some of Teniers' saints! I am one of those unfortunate <lb/>
<pb n="234" entity="z000000574_0261" pid="uva-lib:244713"/>
persons to whom the sight of these animals is at any time an <lb/>
insufferable annoyance.</p>
<p>Thus constitutionally averse to cats in general, the unexpected <lb/>
apparition of this one in particular utterly confounded me. <lb/>
When I had a little recovered from the fascination of its glance, <lb/>
I started up; the cat fled, and emboldened by this, I rushed out <lb/>
of the house in pursuit; but it had disappeared. It was the only <lb/>
time I ever saw one in the valley, and how it got there I cannot <lb/>
imagine. It is just possible that it might have escaped from one <lb/>
of the ships at Nukuheva. It was in vain to seek information <lb/>
on the subject from the natives; since none of them had seen <lb/>
the animal, the appearance of which remains a mystery to me <lb/>
to this day.</p>
<p>Among the few animals which are to be met with in Typee, <lb/>
there were none which I looked upon with more interest than a <lb/>
beautiful golden-hued species of lizard. It measured perhaps <lb/>
five inches from head to tail, and was most gracefully <reg orig="propor-|tioned">proportioned</reg>. <lb/>
Numbers of these creatures were to be seen basking in <lb/>
the sunshine upon the thatching of the houses, and multitudes at <lb/>
all hours of the day showed their glittering sides as they ran <lb/>
frolicking between the spears of grass or raced in troops up and <lb/>
down the tall shafts of the cocoa-nut trees. But the remarkable <lb/>
beauty of these little animals and their lively ways were not <lb/>
their only claims upon my admiration. They were perfectly <lb/>
tame and insensible to fear. Frequently, after seating myself <lb/>
upon the ground in some shady place during the heat of the day, <lb/>
I would be completely overrun with them. If I brushed one off <lb/>
my arm, it would leap perhaps into my hair: when I tried to <lb/>
frighten it away by gently pinching its leg, it would turn for <lb/>
protection to the very hand that attacked it.</p>
<p>The birds are also remarkably tame. If you happened to see <lb/>
one perched upon a branch within reach of your arm, and <reg orig="ad-|vanced">advanced</reg> <lb/>
towards it, it did not fly away immediately, but waited <lb/>
quietly looking at you, until you could almost touch it, and then <lb/>
took wing slowly, less alarmed at your presence, it would seem, <lb/>
than desirous of removing itself from your path. Had salt been <lb/>
less scarce in the valley than it was, this was the very place to <lb/>
have gone birding with it.</p>
<p>I remember that once, on an uninhabited island of the <reg orig="Galli-|pagos">Gallipagos</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="235" entity="z000000574_0262" pid="uva-lib:244714"/>
a bird alighted on my outstretched arm, while its mate <lb/>
chirped from an adjoining tree. Its tameness, far from shocking <lb/>
me, as a similar occurrence did Selkirk, imparted to me the most <lb/>
exquisite thrill of delight I ever experienced; and with <reg orig="some-|what">somewhat</reg> <lb/>
of the same pleasure did I afterwards behold the birds and <lb/>
lizards of the valley show their confidence in the kindliness of <lb/>
man.</p>
<p>Among the numerous afflictions which the Europeans have <lb/>
entailed upon some of the natives of the South Seas, is the <reg orig="acci-|dental">accidental</reg> <lb/>
introduction among them of that enemy of all repose and <lb/>
ruffler of even tempers&mdash;the Mosquito. At the Sandwich Islands <lb/>
and at two or three of the Society group there are now thriving <lb/>
colonies of these insects, who promise ere long to supplant <reg orig="alto-|gether">altogether</reg> <lb/>
the aboriginal sand-flies. They sting, buzz, and torment, <lb/>
from one end of the year to the other, and by incessantly <reg orig="exas-|perating">exasperating</reg> <lb/>
the natives materially obstruct the benevolent labours of <lb/>
the missionaries.</p>
<p>From this grievous visitation, however, the Typees are as yet <lb/>
wholly exempt; but its place is unfortunately in some degree <lb/>
supplied by the occasional presence of a minute species of fly, <lb/>
which, without stinging, is nevertheless productive of no little <lb/>
annoyance. The tameness of the birds and lizards is as nothing <lb/>
when compared to the fearless confidence of this insect. He will <lb/>
perch upon one of your eye-lashes, and go to roost there, if you <lb/>
do not disturb him, or force his way through your hair, or along <lb/>
the cavity of the nostril, till you almost fancy he is resolved to <lb/>
explore the very brain itself. On one occasion I was so <reg orig="incon-|siderate">inconsiderate</reg> <lb/>
as to yawn while a number of them were hovering <lb/>
around me. I never repeated the act. Some half-dozen darted <lb/>
into the open apartment, and began walking about its ceiling; <lb/>
the sensation was dreadful. I involuntarily closed my mouth, <lb/>
and the poor creatures being enveloped in inner darkness, must <lb/>
in their consternation have stumbled over my palate, and been <lb/>
precipitated into the gulf beneath. At any rate, though I <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
charitably held my mouth open for at least five minutes, <lb/>
with a view of affording egress to the stragglers, none of them <lb/>
ever availed themselves of the opportunity.</p>
<p>There are no wild animals of any kind on the island, unless it <lb/>
be decided that the natives themselves are such. The mountains <lb/>
<pb n="236" entity="z000000574_0263" pid="uva-lib:244715"/>
and the interior present to the eye nothing but silent solitudes, <lb/>
unbroken by the roar of beasts of prey, and enlivened by few <lb/>
tokens even of minute animated existence. There are no <reg orig="ve-|nomous">venomous</reg> <lb/>
reptiles, and no snakes of any description to be found in <lb/>
any of the valleys.</p>
<p>In a company of Marquesan natives the weather affords no <lb/>
topic of conversation. It can hardly be said to have any <reg orig="vicis-|situdes">vicissitudes</reg>. <lb/>
The rainy season, it is true, brings frequent showers, <lb/>
but they are intermitting and refreshing. When an islander <lb/>
bound on some expedition rises from his couch in the morning, <lb/>
he is never solicitous to peep out and see how the sky looks, or <lb/>
ascertain from what quarter the wind blows. He is always sure <lb/>
of a "fine day," and the promise of a few genial showers he hails <lb/>
with pleasure. There is never any of that "remarkable weather" <lb/>
on the island which from time immemorial has been experienced <lb/>
in America, and still continues to call forth the wondering <reg orig="con-|versational">conversational</reg> <lb/>
exclamations of its elderly citizens. Nor do there <lb/>
even occur any of those eccentric meteorological changes which <lb/>
elsewhere surprise us. In the valley of Typee ice-creams would <lb/>
never be rendered less acceptable by sudden frosts, nor would <reg orig="pic-|nic">picnic</reg> <lb/>
parties be deferred on account of inauspicious snow-storms: <lb/>
for there day follows day in one unvarying round of summer and <lb/>
sunshine, and the whole year is one long tropical month of June <lb/>
just melting into July.</p>
<p>It is this genial climate which causes the cocoa-nuts to flourish <lb/>
as they do. This invaluable fruit, brought to perfection by the <lb/>
rich soil of the Marquesas, and borne aloft on a stately column <lb/>
more than a hundred feet from the ground, would seem at first <lb/>
almost inaccessible to the simple natives. Indeed the slender, <lb/>
smooth, and soaring shaft, without a single limb or protuberance <lb/>
of any kind to assist one in mounting it, presents an obstacle only <lb/>
to be overcome by the surprising agility and ingenuity of the <lb/>
islanders. It might be supposed that their indolence would lead <lb/>
them patiently to await the period when the ripened nuts, slowly <lb/>
parting from their stems, fall one by one to the ground. This <lb/>
certainly would be the case, were it not that the young fruit, <lb/>
encased in a soft green husk, with the incipient meat adhering <lb/>
in a jelly-like pellicle to its sides, and containing a bumper of the <lb/>
most delicious nectar, is what they chiefly prize. They have at <lb/>
<pb n="237" entity="z000000574_0264" pid="uva-lib:244716"/>
least twenty different terms to express as many progressive stages <lb/>
in the growth of the nut. Many of them reject the fruit <reg orig="alto-|gether">altogether</reg> <lb/>
except at a particular period of its growth, which, <reg orig="incre-|dible">incredible</reg> <lb/>
as it may appear, they seemed to me to be able to ascertain <lb/>
within an hour or two. Others are still more capricious in their <lb/>
tastes; and after gathering together a heap of the nuts of all <lb/>
ages, and ingeniously tapping them, will sip first from one and <lb/>
then from another, as fastidiously as some delicate wine-bibber <lb/>
experimenting glass in hand among his dusty demijohns of <reg orig="dif-|ferent">different</reg> <lb/>
vintages.</p>
<p>Some of the young men, with more flexible frames than their <lb/>
comrades, and perhaps with more courageous souls, had a way of <lb/>
walking up the trunk of the cocoa-nut trees which to me seemed <lb/>
little less than miraculous; and when looking at them in the act, <lb/>
I experienced that curious perplexity a child feels when he <reg orig="be-|holds">beholds</reg> <lb/>
a fly moving feet uppermost along a ceiling.</p>
<p>I will endeavour to describe the way in which Narnee, a noble <lb/>
young chief, sometimes performed this feat for my peculiar <reg orig="gra-|tification">gratification</reg>; <lb/>
but his preliminary performances must also be <reg orig="re-|corded">recorded</reg>. <lb/>
Upon my signifying my desire that he should pluck <lb/>
me the young fruit of some particular tree, the handsome savage, <lb/>
throwing himself into a sudden attitude of surprise, feigns <reg orig="as-|tonishment">astonishment</reg> <lb/>
at the apparent absurdity of the request. <reg orig="Maintain-|ing">Maintaining</reg> <lb/>
this position for a moment, the strange emotions depicted on <lb/>
his countenance soften down into one of humorous resignation to <lb/>
my will, and then looking wistfully up to the tufted top of the <lb/>
tree, he stands on tip-toe, straining his neck and elevating his <lb/>
arm, as though endeavouring to reach the fruit from the ground <lb/>
where he stands. As if defeated in this childish attempt, he now <lb/>
sinks to the earth despondingly, beating his breast in well-acted <lb/>
despair; and then, starting to his feet all at once, and throwing <lb/>
back his head, raises both hands, like a school-boy about to catch <lb/>
a falling ball. After continuing this for a moment or two, as <lb/>
if in expectation that the fruit was going to be tossed down to <lb/>
him by some good spirit in the tree-top, he turns wildly round in <lb/>
another fit of despair, and scampers off to the distance of thirty <lb/>
or forty yards. Here he remains awhile, eyeing the tree, the <lb/>
very picture of misery; but the next moment, receiving, as it <lb/>
were, a flash of inspiration, he rushes again towards it, and <reg orig="clasp-|ing">clasping</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="238" entity="z000000574_0265" pid="uva-lib:244717"/>
both arms about the trunk, with one elevated a little above <lb/>
the other, he presses the soles of his feet close together against <lb/>
the tree, extending his legs from it until they are nearly <reg orig="hori-|zontal">horizontal</reg>, <lb/>
and his body becomes doubled into an arch; then, hand <lb/>
over hand and foot after foot, he rises from the earth with steady <lb/>
rapidity, and almost before you are aware of it, has gained the <lb/>
cradled and embowered nest of nuts, and with boisterous glee <lb/>
flings the fruit to the ground.</p>
<p>This mode of walking the tree is only practicable where the <lb/>
trunk declines considerably from the perpendicular. This, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
is almost always the case; some of the perfectly straight <lb/>
shafts of the trees leaning at an angle of thirty degrees.</p>
<p>The less active among the men, and many of the children of <lb/>
the valley, have another method of climbing. They take a broad <lb/>
and stout piece of bark, and secure either end of it to their <lb/>
ankles; so that when the feet thus confined are extended apart, a <lb/>
space of little more than twelve inches is left between them. <lb/>
This contrivance greatly facilitates the act of climbing. The <lb/>
band pressed against the tree, and closely embracing it, yields a <lb/>
pretty firm support; while with the arms clasped about the <lb/>
trunk, and at regular intervals sustaining the body, the feet are <lb/>
drawn up nearly a yard at a time, and a corresponding elevation <lb/>
of the hands immediately succeeds. In this way I have seen <lb/>
little children, scarcely five years of age, fearlessly climbing the <lb/>
slender pole of a young cocoa-nut tree, and while hanging perhaps <lb/>
fifty feet from the ground, receive the plaudits of their parents <lb/>
beneath, who clapped their hands, and encouraged them to mount <lb/>
still higher.</p>
<p>What, thought I, on first witnessing one of these exhibitions, <lb/>
would the nervous mothers of America and England say to a <lb/>
similar display of hardihood in any of their children? The <lb/>
Lacedemonian nations might have approved of it, but most <lb/>
modern dames would have gone into hysterics at the sight.</p>
<p>At the top of the cocoa-nut tree the numerous branches, <reg orig="ra-|diating">radiating</reg> <lb/>
on all sides from a common centre, form a sort of green <lb/>
and waving basket, between the leaflets of which you just discern <lb/>
the nuts thickly clustering together, and on the loftier trees <lb/>
looking no bigger from the ground than bunches of grapes. I <lb/>
remember one adventurous little fellow&mdash;Too-Too was the rascal's <lb/>
<pb n="239" entity="z000000574_0266" pid="uva-lib:244718"/>
name&mdash;who had built himself a sort of aerial baby-house in the <lb/>
picturesque tuft of a tree adjoining Marheyo's habitation. He <lb/>
used to spend hours there,&mdash;rustling among the branches, and <lb/>
shouting with delight every time the strong gusts of wind <reg orig="rush-|ing">rushing</reg> <lb/>
down from the mountain's side swayed to and fro the tall and <lb/>
flexible column on which he was perched. Whenever I heard <lb/>
Too-Too's musical voice, sounding strangely to the ear from so <lb/>
great a height, and beheld him peeping down upon me from out <lb/>
his leafy covert, he always recalled to my mind Dibdin's lines&mdash;</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>"There's a sweet little cherub that sits up aloft,</l>
<l>To look out for the life of poor Jack."</l>
</lg>
<p>Birds&mdash;bright and beautiful birds&mdash;fly over the valley of <lb/>
Typee. You see them perched aloft among the immovable <lb/>
boughs of the majestic bread-fruit trees, or gently swaying on the <lb/>
elastic branches of the Omoo; skimming over the palmetto <lb/>
thatching of the bamboo huts; passing like spirits on the wing <lb/>
through the shadows of the grove, and sometimes descending <lb/>
into the bosom of the valley in gleaming flights from the <reg orig="moun-|tains">mountains</reg>. <lb/>
Their plumage is purple and azure, crimson and white, <lb/>
black and gold; with bills of every tint:&mdash;bright bloody-red, <lb/>
jet black, and ivory white; and their eyes are bright and <reg orig="spark-|ling">sparkling</reg>; <lb/>
they go sailing through the air in starry throngs; but <lb/>
alas! the spell of dumbness is upon them all&mdash;there is not a <lb/>
single warbler in the valley!</p>
<p>I know not why it was, but the sight of these birds, generally <lb/>
the ministers of gladness, always oppressed me with melancholy. <lb/>
As in their dumb beauty they hovered by me whilst I was <reg orig="walk-|ing">walking</reg>, <lb/>
or looked down upon me with steady curious eyes from out <lb/>
the foliage, I was almost inclined to fancy that they knew they <lb/>
were gazing upon a stranger, and that they commiserated his <lb/>
fate.</p>

and Tabooing&mdash;Two Anecdotes in illustration of the latter&mdash;A few <lb/>
thoughts on the Typee Dialect.</hi></p>
</argument>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> one of my strolls with Kory-Kory, in passing along the border <lb/>
of a thick growth of bushes, my attention was arrested by a <reg orig="sin-|gular">singular</reg> <lb/>
noise. On entering the thicket I witnessed for the first <lb/>
time the operation of tattooing as performed by these islanders.</p>
<p>I beheld a man extended flat upon his back on the ground, <lb/>
and, despite the forced composure of his countenance, it was <lb/>
evident that he was suffering agony. His tormentor bent over <lb/>
him, working away for all the world like a stone-cutter with <lb/>
mallet and chisel. In one hand he held a short slender stick, <lb/>
pointed with a shark's tooth, on the upright end of which he <lb/>
tapped with a small hammer-like piece of wood, thus puncturing <lb/>
the skin, and charging it with the colouring matter in which the <lb/>
instrument was dipped. A cocoa-nut shell containing this fluid <lb/>
was placed upon the ground. It is prepared by mixing with a <lb/>
vegetable juice the ashes of the "armor," or candle-nut, always <lb/>
preserved for the purpose. Beside the savage, and spread out <lb/>
upon a piece of soiled tappa, were a great number of curious <lb/>
black-looking little implements of bone and wood, used in the <lb/>
various divisions of his art. A few terminated in a single fine <lb/>
point, and, like very delicate pencils, were employed in giving <lb/>
the finishing touches, or in operating upon the more sensitive <lb/>
portions of the body, as was the case in the present instance. <lb/>
Others presented several points distributed in a line, somewhat <lb/>
resembling the teeth of a saw. These were employed in the <lb/>
coarser parts of the work, and particularly in pricking in <lb/>
straight marks. Some presented their points disposed in small <lb/>
figures, and being placed upon the body, were, by a single blow <lb/>
of the hammer, made to leave their indelible impression. I <lb/>
<pb n="241" entity="z000000574_0268" pid="uva-lib:244720"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">R</fw></pb>
observed a few the handles of which were mysteriously curved, <lb/>
as if intended to be introduced into the orifice of the ear, with a <lb/>
view perhaps of beating the tattoo upon the tympanum. <reg orig="Alto-|gether">Altogether</reg>, <lb/>
the sight of these strange instruments recalled to mind <lb/>
that display of cruel-looking mother-of-pearl-handled things <lb/>
which one sees in their velvet-lined cases at the elbow of a <lb/>
dentist.</p>
<p>The artist was not at this time engaged on an original sketch, <lb/>
his subject being a venerable savage, whose tattooing had become <lb/>
somewhat faded with age and needed a few repairs, and <reg orig="accord-|ingly">accordingly</reg> <lb/>
he was merely employed in touching up the works of <lb/>
some of the old masters of the Typee school, as delineated upon <lb/>
the human canvas before him. The parts operated upon were <lb/>
the eyelids, where a longitudinal streak, like the one which <lb/>
adorned Kory-Kory, crossed the countenance of the victim.</p>
<p>In spite of all the efforts of the poor old man, sundry <reg orig="twitch-|ings">twitchings</reg> <lb/>
and screwings of the muscles of the face denoted the <reg orig="exqui-|site">exquisite</reg> <lb/>
sensibility of these shutters to the windows of his soul, which <lb/>
he was now having repainted. But the artist, with a heart as <lb/>
callous as that of an army surgeon, continued his performance, <lb/>
enlivening his labours with a wild chant, tapping away the <lb/>
while as merrily as a woodpecker.</p>
<p>So deeply engaged was he in his work, that he had not observed <lb/>
our approach, until, after having enjoyed an unmolested view of <lb/>
the operation, I chose to attract his attention. As soon as he <lb/>
perceived me, supposing that I sought him in his professional <lb/>
capacity, he seized hold of me in a paroxysm of delight, and was <lb/>
all eagerness to begin the work. When, however, I gave him <lb/>
to understand that he had altogether mistaken my views, nothing <lb/>
could exceed his grief and disappointment. But recovering <lb/>
from this, he seemed determined not to credit my assertion, and <lb/>
grasping his implements, he flourished them about in fearful <lb/>
vicinity to my face, going through an imaginary performance of <lb/>
his art, and every moment bursting into some admiring <reg orig="excla-|mation">exclamation</reg> <lb/>
at the beauty of his designs.</p>
<p>Horrified at the bare thought of being rendered hideous for <lb/>
life if the wretch were to execute his purpose upon me, I <reg orig="strug-|gled">struggled</reg> <lb/>
to get away from him, while Kory-Kory, turning traitor, <lb/>
stood by, and besought me to comply with the outrageous <reg orig="re-|quest">request</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="242" entity="z000000574_0269" pid="uva-lib:244721"/>
On my reiterated refusals the excited artist got half <lb/>
beside himself, and was overwhelmed with sorrow at losing so <lb/>
noble an opportunity of distinguishing himself in his profession.</p>
<p>The idea of engrafting his tattooing upon my white skin filled <lb/>
him with all a painter's enthusiasm: again and again he gazed <lb/>
into my countenance, and every fresh glimpse seemed to add to <lb/>
the vehemence of his ambition. Not knowing to what <reg orig="extremi-|ties">extremities</reg> <lb/>
he might proceed, and shuddering at the ruin he might <lb/>
inflict upon my figure-head, I now endeavoured to draw off his <lb/>
attention from it, and holding out my arm in a fit of desperation, <lb/>
signed to him to commence operations. But he rejected the <lb/>
compromise indignantly, and still continued his attack on my <lb/>
face, as though nothing short of that would satisfy him. When <lb/>
his fore-finger swept across my features, in laying out the borders <lb/>
of those parallel bands which were to encircle my countenance, <lb/>
the flesh fairly crawled upon my bones. At last, half wild with <lb/>
terror and indignation, I succeeded in breaking away from the <lb/>
three savages, and fled towards old Marheyo's house, pursued by <lb/>
the indomitable artist, who ran after me, implements in hand. <lb/>
Kory-Kory, however, at last interfered, and drew him off from <lb/>
the chace.</p>
<p>This incident opened my eyes to a new danger; and I now <lb/>
felt convinced that in some luckless hour I should be disfigured <lb/>
in such a manner as never more to have the <hi rend="italic">face</hi> to return to my <lb/>
countrymen, even should an opportunity offer.</p>
<p>These apprehensions were greatly increased by the desire <lb/>
which King Mehevi and several of the inferior chiefs now <reg orig="mani-|fested">manifested</reg> <lb/>
that I should be tattooed. The pleasure of the king was <lb/>
first signified to me some three days after my casual encounter <lb/>
with Karky the artist. Heavens! what imprecations I showered <lb/>
upon that Karky! Doubtless he had plotted a conspiracy against <lb/>
me and my countenance, and would never rest until his diabolical <lb/>
purpose was accomplished. Several times I met him in various <lb/>
parts of the valley, and, invariably, whenever he descried me, he <lb/>
came running after me with his mallet and chisel, flourishing <lb/>
them about my face as if he longed to begin. What an object <lb/>
he would have made of me!</p>
<p>When the king first expressed his wish to me, I made known <lb/>
to him my utter abhorrence of the measure, and worked myself <lb/>
<pb n="243" entity="z000000574_0270" pid="uva-lib:244722"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">R 2</fw></pb>
into such a state of excitement, that he absolutely stared at me <lb/>
in amazement. It evidently surpassed his majesty's <reg orig="comprehen-|sion">comprehension</reg> <lb/>
how any sober-minded and sensible individual could <reg orig="enter-|tain">entertain</reg> <lb/>
the least possible objection to so beautifying an operation.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards he repeated his suggestion, and meeting with <lb/>
a like repulse, showed some symptoms of displeasure at my <reg orig="ob-|duracy">obduracy</reg>. <lb/>
On his a third time renewing his request, I plainly <lb/>
perceived that something must be done, or my visage was ruined <lb/>
for ever; I therefore screwed up my courage to the sticking <lb/>
point, and declared my willingness to have both arms tattooed <lb/>
from just above the wrist to the shoulder. His majesty was <lb/>
greatly pleased at the proposition, and I was congratulating <lb/>
myself with having thus compromised the matter, when he <reg orig="inti-|mated">intimated</reg> <lb/>
that as a thing of course my face was first to undergo the <lb/>
operation. I was fairly driven to despair; nothing but the utter <lb/>
ruin of my "face divine," as the poets call it, would, I perceived, <lb/>
satisfy the inexorable Mehevi and his chiefs, or rather, that <reg orig="in-|fernal">infernal</reg> <lb/>
Karky, for he was at the bottom of it all.</p>
<p>The only consolation afforded me was a choice of patterns: I <lb/>
was at perfect liberty to have my face spanned by three <reg orig="hori-|zontal">horizontal</reg> <lb/>
bars, after the fashion of my serving-man's; or to have <lb/>
as many oblique stripes slanting across it; or if, like a true <lb/>
courtier, I chose to model my style on that of royalty, I might <lb/>
wear a sort of freemason badge upon my countenance in the <lb/>
shape of a mystic triangle. However, I would have none of <lb/>
these, though the king most earnestly impressed upon my mind <lb/>
that my choice was wholly unrestricted. At last, seeing my <lb/>
unconquerable repugnance, he ceased to importune me.</p>
<p>But not so some other of the savages. Hardly a day passed <lb/>
but I was subjected to their annoying requests, until at last my <lb/>
existence became a burden to me; the pleasures I had previously <lb/>
enjoyed no longer afforded me delight, and all my former desire <lb/>
to escape from the valley now revived with additional force.</p>
<p>A fact which I soon afterwards learned augmented my <reg orig="appre-|hension">apprehension</reg>. <lb/>
The whole system of tattooing was, I found, connected <lb/>
with their religion; and it was evident, therefore, that they were <lb/>
resolved to make a convert of me.</p>
<p>In the decoration of the chiefs it seems to be necessary to <lb/>
exercise the most elaborate pencilling; while some of the inferior <lb/>
<pb n="244" entity="z000000574_0271" pid="uva-lib:244723"/>
natives looked as if they had been daubed over indiscriminately <lb/>
with a house-painter's brush. I remember one fellow who prided <lb/>
himself hugely upon a great oblong patch, placed high upon his <lb/>
back, and who always reminded me of a man with a blister of <lb/>
Spanish flies stuck between his shoulders. Another whom I <lb/>
frequently met had the hollow of his eyes tattooed in two regular <lb/>
squares, and his visual organs being remarkably brilliant, they <lb/>
gleamed forth from out this setting like a couple of diamonds <lb/>
inserted in ebony.</p>
<p>Although convinced that tattooing was a religious observance, <lb/>
still the nature of the connection between it and the superstitious <lb/>
idolatry of the people was a point upon which I could never <lb/>
obtain any information. Like the still more important system <lb/>
of the "Taboo," it always appeared inexplicable to me.</p>
<p>There is a marked similarity, almost an identity, between the <lb/>
religious institutions of most of the Polynesian islands, and in all <lb/>
exists the mysterious "Taboo," restricted in its uses to a greater <lb/>
or less extent. So strange and complex in its arrangements is <lb/>
this remarkable system, that I have in several cases met with <lb/>
individuals who, after residing for years among the islands in the <lb/>
Pacific, and acquiring a considerable knowledge of the language, <lb/>
have nevertheless been altogether unable to give any satisfactory <lb/>
account of its operations. Situated as I was in the Typee valley, <lb/>
I perceived every hour the effects of this all-controlling power, <lb/>
without in the least comprehending it. Those effects were, <lb/>
indeed, wide-spread and universal, pervading the most important <lb/>
as well as the minutest transactions of life. The savage, in <lb/>
short, lives in the continual observance of its dictates, which <lb/>
guide and control every action of his being.</p>
<p>For several days after entering the valley I had been saluted <lb/>
at least fifty times in the twenty-four hours with the talismanic <lb/>
word "Taboo" shrieked in my ears, at some gross violation of <lb/>
its provisions, of which I had unconsciously been guilty. The <lb/>
day after our arrival I happened to hand some tobacco to Toby <lb/>
over the head of a native who sat between us. He started up, <lb/>
as if stung by an adder; while the whole company, manifesting <lb/>
an equal degree of horror, simultaneously screamed out "taboo!" <lb/>
I never again perpetrated a similar piece of ill-manners, which, <lb/>
indeed, was forbidden by the canons of good breeding, as well <lb/>
<pb n="245" entity="z000000574_0272" pid="uva-lib:244724"/>
as by the mandates of the taboo. But it was not always so easy <lb/>
to perceive wherein you had contravened the spirit of this <reg orig="insti-|tution">institution</reg>. <lb/>
I was many times called to order, if I may use the <lb/>
phrase, when I could not for the life of me conjecture what <reg orig="par-|ticular">particular</reg> <lb/>
offence I had committed.</p>
<p>One day I was strolling through a secluded portion of the <lb/>
valley, and hearing the musical sound of the cloth-mallet at a <lb/>
little distance, I turned down a path that conducted me in a few <lb/>
moments to a house where there were some half-dozen girls <reg orig="em-|ployed">employed</reg> <lb/>
in making tappa. This was an operation I had frequently <lb/>
witnessed, and had handled the bark in all the various stages of <lb/>
its preparation. On the present occasion the females were intent <lb/>
upon their occupation, and after looking up and talking gaily to <lb/>
me for a few moments, they resumed their employment. I <lb/>
regarded them for awhile in silence, and then carelessly picking <lb/>
up a handful of the material that lay around, proceeded <reg orig="uncon-|sciously">unconsciously</reg> <lb/>
to pick it apart. While thus engaged, I was suddenly <lb/>
startled by a scream, like that of a whole boarding-school of <lb/>
young ladies just on the point of going into hysterics. Leaping <lb/>
up with the idea of seeing a score of Happar warriors about to <lb/>
perform anew the Sabine atrocity, I found myself confronted <lb/>
by the company of girls, who, having dropped their work, stood <lb/>
before me with starting eyes, swelling bosoms, and fingers pointed <lb/>
in horror towards me.</p>
<p>Thinking that some venomous reptile must be concealed in the <lb/>
bark which I held in my hand, I began cautiously to separate <lb/>
and examine it. Whilst I did so the horrified girls redoubled <lb/>
their shrieks. Their wild cries and frightened motions actually <lb/>
alarmed me, and throwing down the tappa, I was about to rush <lb/>
from the house, when in the same instant their clamours ceased, <lb/>
and one of them seizing me by the arm, pointed to the broken <lb/>
fibres that had just fallen from my grasp, and screamed in my <lb/>
ears the fatal word Taboo!</p>
<p>I subsequently found out that the fabric they were engaged in <lb/>
making was of a peculiar kind, destined to be worn on the heads <lb/>
of the females, and through every stage of its manufacture was <lb/>
guarded by a vigorous taboo, which interdicted the whole <reg orig="mas-|culine">masculine</reg> <lb/>
gender from even so much as touching it.</p>
<p>Frequently in walking through the groves I observed <reg orig="bread-|fruit">breadfruit</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="246" entity="z000000574_0273" pid="uva-lib:244725"/>
and cocoa-nut trees, with a wreath of leaves twined in a <lb/>
peculiar fashion about their trunks. This was the mark of the <lb/>
taboo. The trees themselves, their fruit, and even the shadows <lb/>
they cast upon the ground, were consecrated by its presence. In <lb/>
the same way a pipe, which the king had bestowed upon me, was <lb/>
rendered sacred in the eyes of the natives, none of whom could I <lb/>
ever prevail upon to smoke from it. The bowl was encircled by <lb/>
a woven band of grass, somewhat resembling those Turks' heads <lb/>
occasionally worked in the handles of our whip-stalks.</p>
<p>A similar badge was once braided about my wrist by the royal <lb/>
hand of Mehevi himself, who, as soon as he had concluded the <lb/>
operation, pronounced me "Taboo." This occurred shortly after <lb/>
Toby's disappearance; and were it not that from the first <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg> <lb/>
I had entered the valley the natives had treated me with <lb/>
uniform kindness, I should have supposed that their conduct <lb/>
afterwards was to be ascribed to the fact that I had received this <lb/>
sacred investiture.</p>
<p>The capricious operations of the taboo is not its least <reg orig="remark-|able">remarkable</reg> <lb/>
feature: to enumerate them all would be impossible. Black <lb/>
hogs&mdash;infants to a certain age&mdash;women in an interesting <reg orig="situa-|tion&mdash;young">situation&mdash;young</reg> <lb/>
men while the operation of tattooing their faces is <lb/>
going on&mdash;and certain parts of the valley during the continuance <lb/>
of a shower&mdash;are alike fenced about by the operation of the taboo.</p>
<p>I witnessed a striking instance of its effects in the bay of Tior, <lb/>
my visit to which place has been alluded to in a former part of <lb/>
this narrative. On that occasion our worthy captain formed one <lb/>
of the party. He was a most insatiable sportsman. Outward <lb/>
bound, and off the pitch of Cape Horn, he used to sit on the <lb/>
taffrail, and keep the steward loading three or four old <reg orig="fowling-|pieces">fowling-pieces</reg>, <lb/>
with which he would bring down albatrosses, Cape pigeons, <lb/>
jays, petrels, and divers other marine fowl, who followed <reg orig="chatter-|ing">chattering</reg> <lb/>
in our wake. The sailors were struck aghast at his impiety, <lb/>
and one and all attributed our forty days' beating about that <lb/>
horrid headland to his sacrilegious slaughter of these inoffensive <lb/>
birds.</p>
<p>At Tior he evinced the same disregard for the religious <reg orig="pre-|judices">prejudices</reg> <lb/>
of the islanders, as he had previously shown for the <reg orig="su-|perstitions">superstitions</reg> <lb/>
of the sailors. Having heard that there were a <reg orig="con-|siderable">considerable</reg> <lb/>
number of fowls in the valley&mdash;the progeny of some <lb/>
<pb n="247" entity="z000000574_0274" pid="uva-lib:244726"/>
cocks and hens accidentally left there by an English vessel, and <lb/>
which, being strictly tabooed, flew about almost in a wild state&mdash; <lb/>
he determined to break through all restraints, and be the death <lb/>
of them. Accordingly, he provided himself with a most <reg orig="for-|midable">formidable</reg> <lb/>
looking gun, and announced his landing on the beach <lb/>
by shooting down a noble cock that was crowing what proved to <lb/>
be his own funeral dirge, on the limb of an adjoining tree. <lb/>
"Taboo," shrieked the affrighted savages. "Oh, hang your <lb/>
taboo," says the nautical sportsman; "talk taboo to the marines;" <lb/>
and bang went the piece again, and down came another victim. <lb/>
At this the natives ran scampering through the groves, <reg orig="horror-|struck">horror-struck</reg> <lb/>
at the enormity of the act.</p>
<p>All that afternoon the rocky sides of the valley rang with <reg orig="suc-|cessive">successive</reg> <lb/>
reports, and the superb plumage of many a beautiful fowl <lb/>
was ruffled by the fatal bullet. Had it not been that the French <lb/>
admiral, with a large party, were then in the glen, I have no <lb/>
doubt that the natives, although their tribe was small and <reg orig="dis-|pirited">dispirited</reg>, <lb/>
would have inflicted summary vengeance upon the man <lb/>
who thus outraged their most sacred institutions; as it was, they <lb/>
contrived to annoy him not a little.</p>
<p>Thirsting with his exertions, the skipper directed his steps to <lb/>
a stream; but the savages, who had followed at a little distance, <lb/>
perceiving his object, rushed towards him and forced him away <lb/>
from its bank&mdash;his lips would have polluted it. Wearied at last, <lb/>
he sought to enter a house, that he might rest for a while on the <lb/>
mats; its inmates gathered tumultuously about the door and <lb/>
denied him admittance. He coaxed and blustered by turns, but <lb/>
in vain; the natives were neither to be intimidated nor appeased, <lb/>
and as a final resort he was obliged to call together his boat's <lb/>
crew, and pull away from what he termed the most infernal place <lb/>
he ever stepped upon.</p>
<p>Lucky was it for him and for us that we were not honoured <lb/>
on our departure by a salute of stones from the hands of the <reg orig="ex-|asperated">exasperated</reg> <lb/>
Tiors. In this way, on the neighbouring island of <lb/>
Ropo, were killed, but a few weeks previously, and for a nearly <lb/>
similar offence, the master and three of the crew of the K&mdash;.</p>
<p>I cannot determine with anything approaching to certainty, <lb/>
what power it is that imposes the taboo. When I consider the <lb/>
slight disparity of condition among the islanders&mdash;the very <lb/>
<pb n="248" entity="z000000574_0275" pid="uva-lib:244727"/>
limited and inconsiderable prerogatives of the king and chiefs&mdash; <lb/>
and the loose and indefinite functions of the priesthood, most of <lb/>
whom were hardly to be distinguished from the rest of their <lb/>
countrymen, I am wholly at a loss where to look for the <reg orig="autho-|rity">authority</reg> <lb/>
which regulates this potent institution. It is imposed upon <lb/>
something to-day, and withdrawn to-morrow; while its <reg orig="opera-|tions">operations</reg> <lb/>
in other cases are perpetual. Sometimes its restrictions <lb/>
only affect a single individual&mdash;sometimes a particular family&mdash; <lb/>
sometimes a whole tribe; and in a few instances they extend not <lb/>
merely over the various clans on a single island, but over all <lb/>
the inhabitants of an entire group. In illustration of this latter <lb/>
peculiarity, I may cite the law which forbids a female to enter a <lb/>
canoe&mdash;a prohibition which prevails upon all the northern <reg orig="Mar-|quesas">Marquesas</reg> <lb/>
Islands.</p>
<p>The word itself (taboo) is used in more than one signification. <lb/>
It is sometimes used by a parent to his child, when in the <reg orig="exer-|cise">exercise</reg> <lb/>
of parental authority he forbids it to perform a particular <lb/>
action. Anything opposed to the ordinary customs of the <reg orig="island-|ers">islanders</reg>, <lb/>
although not expressly prohibited, is said to be "taboo."</p>
<p>The Typee language is one very difficult to be acquired; it <lb/>
bears a close resemblance to the other Polynesian dialects, all of <lb/>
which show a common origin. The duplication of words, as <lb/>
"lumee lumee," "poee poee," "muee muee," is one of their <lb/>
peculiar features. But another, and a more annoying one, is the <lb/>
different senses in which one and the same word is employed; its <lb/>
various meanings all have a certain connection, which only makes <lb/>
the matter more puzzling. So one brisk, lively little word is <lb/>
obliged, like a servant in a poor family, to perform all sorts of <lb/>
duties; for instance, one particular combination of syllables <reg orig="ex-|presses">expresses</reg> <lb/>
the ideas of sleep, rest, reclining, sitting, leaning, and all <lb/>
other things anywise analogous thereto, the particular meaning <lb/>
being shown chiefly by a variety of gestures and the eloquent <lb/>
expression of the countenance.</p>
<p>The intricacy of these dialects is another peculiarity. In the <lb/>
Missionary College at Lahainaluna, or Mawee, one of the <reg orig="Sand-|wich">Sandwich</reg> <lb/>
Islands, I saw a tabular exhibition of a Hawiian verb, <reg orig="con-|jugated">conjugated</reg> <lb/>
through all its moods and tenses. It covered the side of <lb/>
a considerable apartment, and I doubt whether Sir William Jones <lb/>
himself would not have despaired of mastering it.</p>

</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Sadly</hi> discursive as I have already been, I must still further <lb/>
entreat the reader's patience, as I am about to string together, <lb/>
without any attempt at order, a few odds and ends of things not <lb/>
hitherto mentioned, but which are either curious in themselves <lb/>
or peculiar to the Typees.</p>
<p>There was one singular custom, observed in old Marheyo's <lb/>
domestic establishment, which often excited my surprise. Every <lb/>
night, before retiring, the inmates of the house gathered together <lb/>
on the mats, and squatting upon their haunches, after the <reg orig="uni-|versal">universal</reg> <lb/>
practice of these islanders, would commence a low, dismal, <lb/>
and monotonous chant, accompanying the voice with the <reg orig="instru-|mental">instrumental</reg> <lb/>
melody produced by two small half-rotten sticks tapped <lb/>
slowly together, a pair of which were held in the hands of each <lb/>
person present. Thus would they employ themselves for an hour <lb/>
or two, sometimes longer. Lying in the gloom which wrapped <lb/>
the further end of the house, I could not avoid looking at them, <lb/>
although the spectacle suggested nothing but unpleasant <reg orig="reflec-|tions">reflections</reg>. <lb/>
The flickering rays of the "armor" nut just served to <lb/>
reveal their savage lineaments, without dispelling the darkness <lb/>
that hovered about them.</p>
<p>Sometimes when, after falling into a kind of doze, and awaking <lb/>
suddenly in the midst of these doleful chantings, my eye would <lb/>
fall upon the wild-looking group engaged in their strange <reg orig="occu-|pation">occupation</reg>, <lb/>
with their naked tattooed limbs, and shaven heads <reg orig="dis-|posed">disposed</reg> <lb/>
in a circle, I was almost tempted to believe that I gazed <lb/>
upon a set of evil beings in the act of working a frightful <lb/>
incantation.</p>
<pb n="250" entity="z000000574_0277" pid="uva-lib:244729"/>
<p>What was the meaning or purpose of this custom, whether it <lb/>
was practised merely as a diversion, or whether it was a religious <lb/>
exercise, a sort of family prayers, I never could discover.</p>
<p>The sounds produced by the natives on these occasions were <lb/>
of a most singular description; and had I not actually been <reg orig="pre-|sent">present</reg>, <lb/>
I never would have believed that such curious noises could <lb/>
have been produced by human beings.</p>
<p>To savages generally is imputed a guttural articulation. This, <lb/>
however, is not always the case, especially among the inhabitants <lb/>
of the Polynesian Archipelago. The labial melody with which <lb/>
the Typee girls carry on an ordinary conversation, giving a <reg orig="mu-|sical">musical</reg> <lb/>
prolongation to the final syllable of every sentence, and <lb/>
chirping out some of the words with a liquid, bird-like accent, <lb/>
was singularly pleasing.</p>
<p>The men, however, are not quite so harmonious in their <reg orig="utter-|ance">utterance</reg>, <lb/>
and when excited upon any subject, would work themselves <lb/>
up into a sort of wordy paroxysm, during which all descriptions <lb/>
of rough-sided sounds were projected from their mouths, with a <lb/>
force and rapidity which was absolutely astonishing.</p>
<ornament type="characters">*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*</ornament>
<p>Although these savages are remarkably fond of chanting, <lb/>
still they appear to have no idea whatever of singing, at least as <lb/>
that art is practised among other nations.</p>
<p>I never shall forget the first time I happened to roar out a <lb/>
stave in the presence of the noble Mehevi. It was a stanza from <lb/>
the "Bavarian broom-seller." His Typean majesty, with all his <lb/>
court, gazed upon me in amazement, as if I had displayed some <lb/>
preternatural faculty which Heaven had denied to them. The <lb/>
king was delighted with the verse; but the chorus fairly <reg orig="trans-|ported">transported</reg> <lb/>
him. At his solicitation I sang it again and again, and <lb/>
nothing could be more ludicrous than his vain attempts to catch <lb/>
the air and the words. The royal savage seemed to think that <lb/>
by screwing all the features of his face into the end of his nose <lb/>
he might possibly succeed in the undertaking, but it failed to <lb/>
answer the purpose; and in the end he gave it up, and consoled <lb/>
himself by listening to my repetition of the sounds fifty times <lb/>
over.</p>
<p>Previous to Mehevi's making the discovery, I had never been <lb/>
aware that there was anything of the nightingale about me; but <lb/>
<pb n="251" entity="z000000574_0278" pid="uva-lib:244730"/>
I was now promoted to the place of court-minstrel, in which <lb/>
capacity I was afterwards perpetually called upon to officiate.</p>
<ornament type="characters">*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*</ornament>
<p>Besides the sticks and the drums, there are no other musical <lb/>
instruments among the Typees, except one which might <reg orig="appro-|priately">appropriately</reg> <lb/>
be denominated a nasal flute. It is somewhat longer <lb/>
than an ordinary fife; is made of a beautiful scarlet-coloured <lb/>
reed; and has four or five stops, with a large hole near one end, <lb/>
which latter is held just beneath the left nostril. The other <lb/>
nostril being closed by a peculiar movement of the muscles about <lb/>
the nose, the breath is forced into the tube, and produces a soft <lb/>
dulcet sound, which is varied by the fingers running at random <lb/>
over the stops. This is a favourite recreation with the females, <lb/>
and one in which Fayaway greatly excelled. Awkward as such <lb/>
an instrument may appear, it was, in Fayaway's delicate little <lb/>
hands, one of the most graceful I have ever seen. A young <lb/>
lady, in the act of tormenting a guitar strung about her neck by <lb/>
a couple of yards of blue ribbon, is not half so engaging.</p>
<ornament type="characters">*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*</ornament>
<p>Singing was not the only means I possessed of diverting the <lb/>
royal Mehevi and his easy-going subjects. Nothing afforded <lb/>
them more pleasure than to see me go through the attitude of <lb/>
pugilistic encounter. As not one of the natives had soul enough <lb/>
in him to stand up like a man, and allow me to hammer away at <lb/>
him, for my own personal gratification and that of the king, <lb/>
I was necessitated to fight with an imaginary enemy, whom <lb/>
I invariably made to knock under to my superior prowess. <lb/>
Sometimes when this sorely battered shadow retreated <reg orig="preci-|pitately">precipitately</reg> <lb/>
towards a group of the savages, and, following him up, <lb/>
I rushed among them, dealing my blows right and left, they <lb/>
would disperse in all directions, much to the enjoyment of <lb/>
Mehevi, the chiefs, and themselves.</p>
<p>The noble art of self-defence appeared to be regarded by them <lb/>
as the peculiar gift of the white man; and I make little doubt <lb/>
but that they supposed armies of Europeans were drawn up <lb/>
provided with nothing else but bony fists and stout hearts, with <lb/>
which they set to in column, and pummelled one another at the <lb/>
word of command.</p>

<pb n="252" entity="z000000574_0279" pid="uva-lib:244731"/>
<p>One day, in company with Kory-Kory, I had repaired to the <lb/>
stream for the purpose of bathing, when I observed a woman <lb/>
sitting upon a rock in the midst of the current, and watching <lb/>
with the liveliest interest the gambols of something, which at <lb/>
first I took to be an uncommonly large species of frog that was <lb/>
sporting in the water near her. Attracted by the novelty of the <lb/>
sight, I waded towards the spot where she sat, and could hardly <lb/>
credit the evidence of my senses when I beheld a little infant, <lb/>
the period of whose birth could not have extended back many <lb/>
days, paddling about as if it had just risen to the surface, after <lb/>
being hatched into existence at the bottom. Occasionally the <lb/>
delighted parent reached out her hands towards it, when the <lb/>
little thing, uttering a faint cry, and striking out its tiny limbs, <lb/>
would sidle for the rock, and the next moment be clasped to its <lb/>
mother's bosom. This was repeated again and again, the baby <lb/>
remaining in the stream about a minute at a time. Once or <lb/>
twice it made wry faces at swallowing a mouthful of water, and <lb/>
choked and spluttered as if on the point of strangling. At such <lb/>
times, however, the mother snatched it up, and by a process <lb/>
scarcely to be mentioned obliged it to eject the fluid. For <lb/>
several weeks afterwards I observed this woman bringing her <lb/>
child down to the stream regularly every day, in the cool of the <lb/>
morning and evening, and treating it to a bath. No wonder <lb/>
that the South Sea Islanders are so amphibious a race, when they <lb/>
are thus launched into the water as soon as they see the light. <lb/>
I am convinced that it is as natural for a human being to swim <lb/>
as it is for a duck. And yet in civilized communities how many <lb/>
able-bodied individuals die, like so many drowning kittens, from <lb/>
the occurrence of the most trivial accidents!</p>
<ornament type="characters">*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*</ornament>
<p>The long, luxuriant, and glossy tresses of the Typee damsels <lb/>
often attracted my admiration. A fine head of hair is the pride <lb/>
and joy of every woman's heart! Whether, against the express <lb/>
will of Providence, it is twisted up on the crown of the head and <lb/>
there coiled away like a rope on a ship's deck; whether it be <lb/>
stuck behind the ears and hangs down like the swag of a small <lb/>
window-curtain; or whether it be permitted to flow over the <lb/>
shoulders in natural ringlets, it is always the pride of the owner, <lb/>
and the glory of the toilette.</p>
<pb n="253" entity="z000000574_0280" pid="uva-lib:244732"/>
<p>The Typee girls devote much of their time to the dressing of <lb/>
their fair and redundant locks. After bathing, as they sometimes <lb/>
do five or six times every day, the hair is carefully dried, and if <lb/>
they have been in the sea, invariably washed in fresh water, and <lb/>
anointed with a highly scented oil extracted from the meat of <lb/>
the cocoa-nut. This oil is obtained in great abundance by the <lb/>
following very simple process:</p>
<p>A large vessel of wood, with holes perforated in the bottom, is <lb/>
filled with the pounded meat, and exposed to the rays of the sun. <lb/>
As the oleaginous matter exudes, it falls in drops through the <lb/>
apertures into a wide-mouthed calabash placed underneath. <lb/>
After a sufficient quantity has been thus collected, the oil <reg orig="under-|goes">undergoes</reg> <lb/>
a purifying process, and is then poured into the small <lb/>
spherical shells of the nuts of the moo-tree, which are hollowed <lb/>
out to receive it. These nuts are then hermetically sealed with <lb/>
a resinous gum, and the vegetable fragrance of their green rind <lb/>
soon imparts to the oil a delightful odour. After the lapse of a <lb/>
few weeks the exterior shell of the nuts becomes quite dry and <lb/>
hard, and assumes a beautiful carnation tint; and when opened <lb/>
they are found to be about two-thirds full of an ointment of a <lb/>
light yellow colour, and diffusing the sweetest perfume. This <lb/>
elegant little odorous globe would not be out of place even upon <lb/>
the toilette of a queen. Its merits as a preparation for the hair <lb/>
are undeniable&mdash;it imparts to it a superb gloss and a silky <reg orig="fine-|ness">fineness</reg>.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">From</hi> the time of my casual encounter with Karky the artist, <lb/>
my life was one of absolute wretchedness. Not a day passed but <lb/>
I was persecuted by the solicitations of some of the natives to <lb/>
subject myself to the odious operation of tattooing. Their <reg orig="im-|portunities">importunities</reg> <lb/>
drove me half wild, for I felt how easily they might <lb/>
work their will upon me regarding this or anything else which <lb/>
they took into their heads. Still, however, the behaviour of the <lb/>
islanders towards me was as kind as ever. Fayaway was quite <lb/>
as engaging; Kory-Kory as devoted: and Mehevi the king just <lb/>
as gracious and condescending as before. But I had now been <lb/>
three months in their valley, as nearly as I could estimate; I had <lb/>
grown familiar with the narrow limits to which my wanderings <lb/>
had been confined; and I began bitterly to feel the state of <reg orig="cap-|tivity">captivity</reg> <lb/>
in which I was held. There was no one with whom I <lb/>
could freely converse; no one to whom I could communicate <lb/>
my thoughts; no one who could sympathise with my sufferings. <lb/>
A thousand times I thought how much more endurable would <lb/>
have been my lot had Toby still been with me. But I was left <lb/>
alone, and the thought was terrible to me. Still, despite my <lb/>
griefs, I did all in my power to appear composed and cheerful, <lb/>
well knowing that by manifesting any uneasiness, or any desire <lb/>
to escape, I should only frustrate my object.</p>
<p>It was during the period I was in this unhappy frame of <lb/>
mind that the painful malady under which I had been <reg orig="labour-|ing&mdash;after">labouring&mdash;after</reg> <lb/>
having almost completely subsided&mdash;began again to <lb/>
show itself, and with symptoms as violent as ever. This added <lb/>
calamity nearly unmanned me; the recurrence of the complaint <lb/>
proved that without powerful remedial applications all hope of <lb/>
cure was futile; and when I reflected that just beyond the <reg orig="eleva-|tions">elevations</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="255" entity="z000000574_0282" pid="uva-lib:244734"/>
which bound me in, was the medical relief I needed, and <lb/>
that, although so near, it was impossible for me to avail myself of <lb/>
it, the thought was misery.</p>
<p>In this wretched situation, every circumstance which evinced <lb/>
the savage nature of the beings at whose mercy I was, augmented <lb/>
the fearful apprehensions that consumed me. An occurrence <lb/>
which happened about this time affected me most powerfully.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned that from the ridge-pole of <reg orig="Mar-|heyo's">Marheyo's</reg> <lb/>
house were suspended a number of packages enveloped in <lb/>
tappa. Many of these I had often seen in the hands of the <lb/>
natives, and their contents had been examined in my presence. <lb/>
But there were three packages hanging very nearly over the <lb/>
place where I lay, which from their remarkable appearance had <lb/>
often excited my curiosity. Several times I had asked <reg orig="Kory-|Kory">Kory-Kory</reg> <lb/>
to show me their contents; but my servitor, who in almost <lb/>
every other particular had acceded to my wishes, always refused <lb/>
to gratify me in this.</p>
<p>One day, returning unexpectedly from the "Ti," my arrival <lb/>
seemed to throw the inmates of the house into the greatest <reg orig="con-|fusion">confusion</reg>. <lb/>
They were seated together on the mats, and by the lines <lb/>
which extended from the roof to the floor I immediately perceived <lb/>
that the mysterious packages were for some purpose or other <lb/>
under inspection. The evident alarm the savages betrayed filled <lb/>
me with forebodings of evil, and with an uncontrollable desire to <lb/>
penetrate the secret so jealously guarded. Despite the efforts of <lb/>
Marheyo and Kory-Kory to restrain me, I forced my way into <lb/>
the midst of the circle, and just caught a glimpse of three human <lb/>
heads, which others of the party were hurriedly enveloping in <lb/>
the coverings from which they had been taken.</p>
<p>One of the three I distinctly saw. It was in a state of perfect <lb/>
preservation, and, from the slight glimpse I had of it, seemed to <lb/>
have been subjected to some smoking operation which had <reg orig="re-|duced">reduced</reg> <lb/>
it to the dry, hard, and mummy-like appearance it <reg orig="pre-|sented">presented</reg>. <lb/>
The two long scalp-locks were twisted up into balls <lb/>
upon the crown of the head in the same way that the individual <lb/>
had worn them during life. The sunken cheeks were rendered <lb/>
yet more ghastly by the rows of glistening teeth which protruded <lb/>
from between the lips, while the sockets of the eyes&mdash;filled with <lb/>
oval bits of mother-of-pearl shell, with a black spot in the centre <lb/>
&mdash;heightened the hideousness of its aspect.</p>
<pb n="256" entity="z000000574_0283" pid="uva-lib:244735"/>
<p>Two of the three were heads of the islanders; but the third, <lb/>
to my horror, was that of a white man. Although it had been <lb/>
quickly removed from my sight, still the glimpse I had of it was <lb/>
enough to convince me that I could not be mistaken.</p>
<p>Gracious God! what dreadful thoughts entered my mind! In <lb/>
solving this mystery perhaps I had solved another, and the fate <lb/>
of my lost companion might be revealed in the shocking spectacle <lb/>
I had just witnessed. I longed to have torn off the folds of <lb/>
cloth, and satisfied the awful doubts under which I laboured. <lb/>
But before I had recovered from the consternation into which I <lb/>
had been thrown, the fatal packages were hoisted aloft and once <lb/>
more swung over my head. The natives now gathered round me <lb/>
tumultuously, and laboured to convince me that what I had just <lb/>
seen were the heads of three Happar warriors, who had been slain <lb/>
in battle. This glaring falsehood added to my alarm, and it was <lb/>
not until I reflected that I had observed the packages swinging <lb/>
from their elevation before Toby's disappearance, that I could <lb/>
at all recover my composure.</p>
<p>But although this horrible apprehension had been dispelled, I <lb/>
had discovered enough to fill me, in my present state of mind, <lb/>
with the most bitter reflections. It was plain that I had seen the <lb/>
last relic of some unfortunate wretch, who must have been <reg orig="mas-|sacred">massacred</reg> <lb/>
on the beach by the savages, in one of those perilous <lb/>
trading adventures which I have before described.</p>
<p>It was not, however, alone the murder of the stranger that <lb/>
overcame me with gloom. I shuddered at the idea of the <reg orig="subse-|quent">subsequent</reg> <lb/>
fate his inanimate body might have met with. Was the <lb/>
same doom reserved for me? Was I destined to perish like him <lb/>
&mdash;like him, perhaps, to be devoured, and my head to be preserved <lb/>
as a fearful memento of the event? My imagination ran riot in <lb/>
these horrid speculations, and I felt certain that the worst <reg orig="pos-|sible">possible</reg> <lb/>
evils would befal me. But whatever were my misgivings, <lb/>
I studiously concealed them from the islanders, as well as the <lb/>
full extent of the discovery I had made.</p>
<p>Although the assurances which the Typees had often given <lb/>
me, that they never eat human flesh, had not convinced me that <lb/>
such was the case, yet, having been so long a time in the valley <lb/>
without witnessing anything which indicated the existence of the <lb/>
practice, I began to hope that it was an event of very rare <reg orig="occur-|rence">occurrence</reg>, <lb/>
and that I should be spared the horror of witnessing it <lb/>
<pb n="257" entity="z000000574_0284" pid="uva-lib:244736"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">S</fw></pb>
during my stay among them; but, alas! these hopes were soon <lb/>
destroyed.</p>
<p>It is a singular fact, that in all our accounts of cannibal tribes <lb/>
we have seldom received the testimony of an eye-witness to the <lb/>
revolting practice. The horrible conclusion has almost always <lb/>
been derived either from the second-hand evidence of Europeans, <lb/>
or else from the admissions of the savages themselves, after they <lb/>
have in some degree become civilized. The Polynesians are <lb/>
aware of the detestation in which Europeans hold this custom, <lb/>
and therefore invariably deny its existence, and, with the craft <lb/>
peculiar to savages, endeavour to conceal every trace of it.</p>
<p>The excessive unwillingness betrayed by the Sandwich <reg orig="Island-|ers">Islanders</reg>, <lb/>
even at the present day, to allude to the unhappy fate of <lb/>
Cook, has been often remarked. And so well have they <reg orig="suc-|ceeded">succeeded</reg> <lb/>
in covering that event with mystery, that to this very hour, <lb/>
despite all that has been said and written on the subject, it still <lb/>
remains doubtful whether they wreaked upon his murdered body <lb/>
the vengeance they sometimes inflicted upon their enemies.</p>
<p>At Karakikova, the scene of that tragedy, a strip of ship's <lb/>
copper nailed against an upright post in the ground used to <reg orig="in-|form">inform</reg> <lb/>
the traveller that beneath reposed the "remains" of the <lb/>
great circumnavigator. But I am strongly inclined to believe <lb/>
not only that the corpse was refused Christian burial, but that <lb/>
the heart which was brought to Vancouver some time after the <lb/>
event, and which the Hawiians stoutly maintained was that of <lb/>
Captain Cook, was no such thing; and that the whole affair was <lb/>
a piece of imposture which was sought to be palmed off upon the <lb/>
credulous Englishman.</p>
<p>A few years since there was living on the island of Mowee <lb/>
(one of the Sandwich group) an old chief, who, actuated by a <lb/>
morbid desire for notoriety, gave himself out among the foreign <lb/>
residents of the place as the living tomb of Captain Cook's big <lb/>
toe!&mdash;affirming, that at the cannibal entertainment which ensued <lb/>
after the lamented Briton's death, that particular portion of his <lb/>
body had fallen to his share. His indignant countrymen actually <lb/>
caused him to be prosecuted in the native courts, on a charge <lb/>
nearly equivalent to what we term defamation of character; but <lb/>
the old fellow persisting in his assertion, and no invalidating proof <lb/>
being adduced, the plantiffs were cast in the suit, and the <reg orig="can-|nibal">cannibal</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="258" entity="z000000574_0285" pid="uva-lib:244737"/>
reputation of the defendant fully established. This result <lb/>
was the making of his fortune; ever afterwards he was in the <lb/>
habit of giving very profitable audiences to all curious travellers <lb/>
who were desirous of beholding the man who had eaten the great <lb/>
navigator's great toe.</p>
<p>About a week after my discovery of the contents of the <reg orig="mys-|terious">mysterious</reg> <lb/>
packages, I happened to be at the Ti, when another <lb/>
war-alarm was sounded, and the natives rushing to their arms, <lb/>
sallied out to resist a second incursion of the Happar invaders. <lb/>
The same scene was again repeated, only that on this occasion I <lb/>
heard at least fifteen reports of muskets from the mountains <lb/>
during the time that the skirmish lasted. An hour or two after <lb/>
its termination, loud p&aelig;ans chanted through the valley <reg orig="an-|nounced">announced</reg> <lb/>
the approach of the victors. I stood with Kory-Kory <lb/>
leaning against the railing of the pi-pi awaiting their advance, <lb/>
when a tumultuous crowd of islanders emerged with wild <reg orig="cla-|mours">clamours</reg> <lb/>
from the neighbouring groves. In the midst of them <lb/>
marched four men, one preceding the other at regular intervals <lb/>
of eight or ten feet, with poles of a corresponding length, <reg orig="ex-|tended">extended</reg> <lb/>
from shoulder to shoulder, to which were lashed with <lb/>
thongs of bark three long narrow bundles, carefully wrapped in <lb/>
ample coverings of freshly plucked palm-leaves, tacked together <lb/>
with slivers of bamboo. Here and there upon these green <reg orig="winding-|sheets">winding-sheets</reg> <lb/>
might be seen the stains of blood, while the warriors who <lb/>
carried the frightful burdens displayed upon their naked limbs <lb/>
similar sanguinary marks. The shaven head of the foremost had a <lb/>
deep gash upon it, and the clotted gore which had flowed from the <lb/>
wound remained in dry patches around it. This savage seemed <lb/>
to be sinking under the weight he bore. The bright tattooing <lb/>
upon his body was covered with blood and dust; his inflamed <lb/>
eyes rolled in their sockets, and his whole appearance denoted <lb/>
extraordinary suffering and exertion; yet, sustained by some <lb/>
powerful impulse, he continued to advance, while the throng <lb/>
around him with wild cheers sought to encourage him. The <lb/>
other three men were marked about the arms and breasts with <lb/>
several slight wounds, which they somewhat ostentatiously <reg orig="dis-|played">displayed</reg>.</p>
<p>These four individuals, having been the most active in the late <lb/>
encounter, claimed the honour of bearing the bodies of their <lb/>
<pb n="259" entity="z000000574_0286" pid="uva-lib:244738"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">S 2</fw></pb>
slain enemies to the Ti. Such was the conclusion I drew from <lb/>
my own observations, and, as far as I could understand, from the <lb/>
explanation which Kory-Kory gave me.</p>
<p>The royal Mehevi walked by the side of these heroes. He <lb/>
carried in one hand a musket, from the barrel of which was <lb/>
suspended a small canvass pouch of powder, and in the other he <lb/>
grasped a short javelin, which he held before him and regarded <lb/>
with fierce exultation. This javelin he had wrested from a <reg orig="cele-|brated">celebrated</reg> <lb/>
champion of the Happars, who had ignominiously fled, <lb/>
and was pursued by his foe beyond the summit of the mountain.</p>
<p>When within a short distance of the Ti, the warrior with the <lb/>
wounded head, who proved to be Narmonee, tottered forward <lb/>
two or three steps, and fell helplessly to the ground; but not <lb/>
before another had caught the end of the pole from his shoulder, <lb/>
and placed it upon his own.</p>
<p>The excited throng of islanders, who surrounded the person of <lb/>
the king and the dead bodies of the enemy, approached the spot <lb/>
where I stood, brandishing their rude implements of warfare, <lb/>
many of which were bruised and broken, and uttering continual <lb/>
shouts of triumph. When the crowd drew up opposite the Ti, <lb/>
I set myself to watch their proceedings most attentively; but <lb/>
scarcely had they halted when my servitor, who had left my <lb/>
side for an instant, touched my arm, and proposed our returning <lb/>
to Marheyo's house. To this I objected; but, to my surprise, <lb/>
Kory-Kory reiterated his request, and with an unusual vehemence <lb/>
of manner. Still, however, I refused to comply, and was <reg orig="re-|treating">retreating</reg> <lb/>
before him, as in his importunity he pressed upon me, <lb/>
when I felt a heavy hand laid upon my shoulder, and turning <lb/>
round, encountered the bulky form of Mow-Mow, a one-eyed <lb/>
chief, who had just detached himself from the crowd below, and <lb/>
had mounted the rear of the pi-pi upon which we stood. His <lb/>
cheek had been pierced by the point of a spear, and the wound <lb/>
imparted a still more frightful expression to his hideously tattooed <lb/>
face, already deformed by the loss of an eye. The warrior, <lb/>
without uttering a syllable, pointed fiercely in the direction of <lb/>
Marheyo's house, while Kory-Kory, at the same time presenting <lb/>
his back, desired me to mount.</p>
<p>I declined this offer, but intimated my willingness to withdraw, <lb/>
and moved slowly along the piazza, wondering what could be the <lb/>
<pb n="260" entity="z000000574_0287" pid="uva-lib:244739"/>
cause of this unusual treatment. A few minutes' consideration <lb/>
convinced me that the savages were about to celebrate some <lb/>
hideous rite in connection with their peculiar customs, and at <lb/>
which they were determined I should not be present. I <reg orig="de-|scended">descended</reg> <lb/>
from the pi-pi, and attended by Kory-Kory, who on this <lb/>
occasion did not show his usual commiseration for my lameness, <lb/>
but seemed only anxious to hurry me on, walked away from the <lb/>
place. As I passed through the noisy throng, which by this time <lb/>
completely environed the Ti, I looked with fearful curiosity at <lb/>
the three packages, which now were deposited upon the ground; <lb/>
but although I had no doubt as to their contents, still their thick <lb/>
coverings prevented my actually detecting the form of a human <lb/>
body.</p>
<p>The next morning, shortly after sunrise, the same thundering <lb/>
sounds which had awakened me from sleep on the second day of <lb/>
the Feast of Calabashes, assured me that the savages were on the <lb/>
eve of celebrating another, and, as I fully believed, a horrible <lb/>
solemnity.</p>
<p>All the inmates of the house, with the exception of Marheyo, <lb/>
his son, and Tinor, after assuming their gala dresses, departed in <lb/>
the direction of the Taboo Groves.</p>
<p>Although I did not anticipate a compliance with my request, <lb/>
still, with a view of testing the truth of my suspicions, I proposed <lb/>
to Kory-Kory that, according to our usual custom in the morning, <lb/>
we should take a stroll to the Ti: he positively refused; and <lb/>
when I renewed the request, he evinced his determination to <lb/>
prevent my going there; and, to divert my mind from the <reg orig="sub-|ject">subject</reg>, <lb/>
he offered to accompany me to the stream. We accordingly <lb/>
went, and bathed. On our coming back to the house, I was <reg orig="sur-|prised">surprised</reg> <lb/>
to find that all its inmates had returned, and were lounging <lb/>
upon the mats as usual, although the drums still sounded from <lb/>
the groves.</p>
<p>The rest of the day I spent with Kory-Kory and Fayaway, <lb/>
wandering about a part of the valley situated in an opposite <lb/>
direction from the Ti; and whenever I so much as looked towards <lb/>
that building, although it was hidden from view by intervening <lb/>
trees, and at the distance of more than a mile, my attendant <lb/>
would exclaim, "taboo, taboo!"</p>
<p>At the various houses where we stopped, I found many of the <lb/>
<pb n="261" entity="z000000574_0288" pid="uva-lib:244740"/>
inhabitants reclining at their ease, or pursuing some light <reg orig="occu-|pation">occupation</reg>, <lb/>
as if nothing unusual were going forward; but amongst <lb/>
them all I did not perceive a single chief or warrior. When <lb/>
I asked several of the people why they were not at the <lb/>
"Hoolah Hoolah" (the feast), they uniformly answered the <lb/>
question in a manner which implied that it was not intended <lb/>
for them, but for Mehevi, Narmonee, Mow Mow, Kolor, <lb/>
Womonoo, Kalow&mdash;running over, in their desire to make me <lb/>
comprehend their meaning, the names of all the principal chiefs.</p>
<p>Everything, in short, strengthened my suspicions with regard <lb/>
to the nature of the festival they were now celebrating; and <lb/>
which amounted almost to a certainty. While in Nukuheva I <lb/>
had frequently been informed that the whole tribe were never <lb/>
present at these cannibal banquets; but the chiefs and priests <lb/>
only, and everything I now observed agreed with the account.</p>
<p>The sound of the drums continued, without intermission, <lb/>
the whole day, and falling continually upon my ear, caused me <lb/>
a sensation of horror which I am unable to describe. On the <lb/>
following day hearing none of those noisy indications of <reg orig="re-|velry">revelry</reg>, <lb/>
I concluded that the inhuman feast was terminated; and <lb/>
feeling a kind of morbid curiosity to discover whether the Ti <lb/>
might furnish any evidence of what had taken place there, I <reg orig="pro-|posed">proposed</reg> <lb/>
to Kory-Kory to walk there. To this proposition he <reg orig="re-|plied">replied</reg> <lb/>
by pointing with his finger to the newly risen sun, and <lb/>
then up to the zenith, intimating that our visit must be deferred <lb/>
until noon. Shortly after that hour we accordingly proceeded <lb/>
to the Taboo Groves, and as soon as we entered their precincts, <lb/>
I looked fearfully round in quest of some memorial of the <lb/>
scenes which had so lately been acted there; but everything <lb/>
appeared as usual. On reaching the Ti, we found Mehevi and <lb/>
a few chiefs reclining on the mats, who gave me as friendly a <lb/>
reception as ever. No allusions of any kind were made by them <lb/>
to the recent events; and I refrained, for obvious reasons, from <lb/>
referring to them myself.</p>
<p>After staying a short time I took my leave. In passing along <lb/>
the piazza, previously to descending from the pi-pi, I observed a <lb/>
curiously carved vessel of wood, of considerable size, with a cover <lb/>
placed over it, of the same material, and which resembled in shape <lb/>
a small canoe. It was surrounded by a low railing of bamboos, <lb/>
<pb n="262" entity="z000000574_0289" pid="uva-lib:244741"/>
the top of which was scarcely a foot from the ground. As the <lb/>
vessel had been placed in its present position since my last visit, <lb/>
I at once concluded that it must have some connection with the <lb/>
recent festival; and, prompted by a curiosity I could not repress, <lb/>
in passing it I raised one end of the cover; at the same moment <lb/>
the chiefs, perceiving my design, loudly ejaculated, "Taboo! <lb/>
taboo!" But the slight glimpse sufficed; my eyes fell upon the <lb/>
disordered members of a human skeleton, the bones still fresh <lb/>
with moisture, and with particles of flesh clinging to them here <lb/>
and there!</p>
<p>Kory-Kory, who had been a little in advance of me, attracted <lb/>
by the exclamations of the chiefs, turned round in time to <reg orig="wit-|ness">witness</reg> <lb/>
the expression of horror on my countenance. He now <lb/>
hurried towards me, pointing at the same time to the canoe, and <lb/>
exclaiming rapidly, "Puarkee! puarkee!" (Pig, pig). I <reg orig="pre-|tended">pretended</reg> <lb/>
to yield to the deception, and repeated the words after him <lb/>
several times, as though acquiescing in what he said. The other <lb/>
savages, either deceived by my conduct or unwilling to manifest <lb/>
their displeasure at what could not now be remedied, took no <lb/>
further notice of the occurrence, and I immediately left the Ti.</p>
<p>All that night I lay awake, revolving in my mind the fearful <lb/>
situation in which I was placed. The last horrid revelation had <lb/>
now been made, and the full sense of my condition rushed upon <lb/>
my mind with a force I had never before experienced.</p>
<p>Where, thought I, desponding, is there the slightest prospect <lb/>
of escape? The only person who seemed to possess the ability to <lb/>
assist me was the stranger Marnoo; but would he ever return to <lb/>
the valley? and if he did, should I be permitted to hold any <lb/>
communication with him? It seemed as if I were cut off from <lb/>
every source of hope, and that nothing remained but passively to <lb/>
await whatever fate was in store for me. A thousand times I <reg orig="en-|deavoured">endeavoured</reg> <lb/>
to account for the mysterious conduct of the natives. <lb/>
For what conceivable purpose did they thus retain me a captive? <lb/>
What could be their object in treating me with such apparent <lb/>
kindness, and did it not cover some treacherous scheme? Or, if <lb/>
they had no other design than to hold me a prisoner, how should I <lb/>
be able to pass away my days in this narrow valley, deprived of <lb/>
all intercourse with civilized beings, and for ever separated from <lb/>
friends and home?</p>
<pb n="263" entity="z000000574_0290" pid="uva-lib:244742"/>
<p>One only hope remained to me. The French could not long <lb/>
defer a visit to the bay, and if they should permanently locate <lb/>
any of their troops in the valley, the savages could not for any <lb/>
length of time conceal my existence from them. But what <lb/>
reason had I to suppose that I should be spared until such an <lb/>
event occurred&mdash;an event which might be postponed by a <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
different contingencies?</p>

<argument>

Attempt to Escape&mdash;Failure&mdash;Melancholy Situation&mdash;Sympathy of <reg orig="Mar-|heyo">Marheyo</reg>.</hi></p>
</argument>
</opener>
<p>"<hi rend="small-caps">Marnoo,</hi> Marnoo pemi!" Such were the welcome sounds <lb/>
which fell upon my ear some ten days after the events related in <lb/>
the preceding chapter. Once more the approach of the stranger <lb/>
was heralded, and the intelligence operated upon me like magic. <lb/>
Again I should be able to converse with him in my own language; <lb/>
and I resolved at all hazards to concert with him some scheme, <lb/>
however desperate, to rescue me from a condition that had now <lb/>
become insupportable.</p>
<p>As he drew near, I remembered with many misgivings the <lb/>
inauspicious termination of our former interview; and when he <lb/>
entered the house, I watched with intense anxiety the reception <lb/>
he met with from its inmates. To my joy, his appearance was <lb/>
hailed with the liveliest pleasure; and accosting me kindly, he <lb/>
seated himself by my side, and entered into conversation with the <lb/>
natives around him. It soon appeared, however, that on this <lb/>
occasion he had not any intelligence of importance to <reg orig="commu-|nicate">communicate</reg>. <lb/>
I inquired of him from whence he had last come? He <lb/>
replied from Pueearka, his native valley, and that he intended <lb/>
to return to it the same day.</p>
<p>At once it struck me that, could I but reach that valley under <lb/>
his protection, I might easily from thence reach Nukuheva by <lb/>
water; and animated by the prospect which this plan held out, <lb/>
I disclosed it in a few brief words to the stranger, and asked <lb/>
him how it could be best accomplished. My heart sunk within <lb/>
me when in his broken English he answered me that it could <lb/>
never be effected. "Kannaka no let you go no where," he said; <lb/>
"you taboo. Why you no like to stay? Plenty moee-moee <lb/>
(sleep)&mdash;plenty ki-ki (eat)&mdash;plenty whihenee (young girls)&mdash; <lb/>
Oh, very good place Typee! Suppose you no like this bay, <lb/>
<pb n="265" entity="z000000574_0292" pid="uva-lib:244744"/>
why you come? You no hear about Typee? All white men <lb/>
afraid Typee, so no white men come."</p>
<p>These words distressed me beyond belief; and when I again <lb/>
related to him the circumstances under which I had descended <lb/>
into the valley, and sought to enlist his sympathies in my behalf <lb/>
by appealing to the bodily misery I endured, he listened to <lb/>
me with impatience, and cut me short by exclaiming passionately, <lb/>
"Me no hear you talk any more; by by Kannaka get mad, kill <lb/>
you and me too. No you see he no want you to speak to me <lb/>
at all?&mdash;you see&mdash;ah! by by you no mind&mdash;you get well, he <lb/>
kill you, eat you, hang you head up there, like Happar <reg orig="Kan-|naka.&mdash;Now">Kannaka.&mdash;Now</reg> <lb/>
you listen&mdash;but no talk any more. By by I go;&mdash; <lb/>
you see way I go.&mdash;Ah! then some night Kannaka all <reg orig="moee-|moee">moee-moee</reg> <lb/>
(sleep)&mdash;you run away, you come Pueearka. I speak <lb/>
Pueearka Kannaka&mdash;he no harm you&mdash;ah! then I take you my <lb/>
canoe Nukuheva&mdash;and you no run away ship no more." With <lb/>
these words, enforced by a vehemence of gesture I cannot <reg orig="de-|scribe">describe</reg>, <lb/>
Marnoo started from my side, and immediately engaged <lb/>
in conversation with some of the chiefs who had entered the <lb/>
house.</p>
<p>It would have been idle for me to have attempted resuming <lb/>
the interview so peremptorily terminated by Marnoo, who was <lb/>
evidently little disposed to compromise his own safety by any <lb/>
rash endeavours to ensure mine. But the plan he had suggested <lb/>
struck me as one which might possibly be accomplished, and I <lb/>
resolved to act upon it as speedily as possible.</p>
<p>Accordingly, when he rose to depart, I accompanied him with <lb/>
the natives outside of the house, with a view of carefully noting <lb/>
the path he would take in leaving the valley. Just before <reg orig="leap-|ing">leaping</reg> <lb/>
from the pi-pi he clasped my hand, and looking significantly <lb/>
at me, exclaimed, "Now you see&mdash;you do what I tell you&mdash;ah! <lb/>
then you do good;&mdash;you no do so&mdash;ah! then you die." The <lb/>
next moment he waved his spear in adieu to the islanders, and <lb/>
following the route that conducted to a defile in the mountains <lb/>
lying opposite the Happar side, was soon out of sight.</p>
<p>A mode of escape was now presented to me, but how was I to <lb/>
avail myself of it? I was continually surrounded by the savages; <lb/>
I could not stir from one house to another without being attended <lb/>
by some of them; and even during the hours devoted to slumber <lb/>
<pb n="266" entity="z000000574_0293" pid="uva-lib:244745"/>
the slightest movement which I made seemed to attract the notice <lb/>
of those who shared the mats with me. In spite of these obstacles, <lb/>
however, I determined forthwith to make the attempt. To do so <lb/>
with any prospect of success, it was necessary that I should have <lb/>
at least two hours' start before the islanders should discover my <lb/>
absence; for with such facility was any alarm spread through <lb/>
the valley, and so familiar, of course, were the inhabitants with <lb/>
the intricacies of the groves, that I could not hope, lame and <lb/>
feeble as I was, and ignorant of the route, to secure my escape <lb/>
unless I had this advantage. It was also by night alone that I <lb/>
could hope to accomplish my object, and then only by adopting <lb/>
the utmost precaution.</p>
<p>The entrance to Marheyo's habitation was through a low <lb/>
narrow opening in its wicker-work front. This passage, for no <lb/>
conceivable reason that I could devise, was always closed after <lb/>
the household had retired to rest, by drawing a heavy slide across <lb/>
it, composed of a dozen or more bits of wood, ingeniously fastened <lb/>
together by seizings of sinnate. When any of the inmates chose <lb/>
to go outside, the noise occasioned by the removing of this rude <lb/>
door awakened every body else; and on more than one occasion <lb/>
I had remarked that the islanders were nearly as irritable as more <lb/>
civilized beings under similar circumstances.</p>
<p>The difficulty thus placed in my way I determined to obviate <lb/>
in the following manner. I would get up boldly in the course of <lb/>
the night, and drawing the slide, issue from the house, and <reg orig="pre-|tend">pretend</reg> <lb/>
that my object was merely to procure a drink from the <reg orig="cala-|bash">calabash</reg>, <lb/>
which always stood without the dwelling on the corner of <lb/>
the pi-pi. On re-entering I would purposely omit closing the <lb/>
passage after me, and trusting that the indolence of the savages <lb/>
would prevent them from repairing my neglect, would return to <lb/>
my mat, and waiting patiently until all were again asleep, I <lb/>
would then steal forth, and at once take the route to Pueearka.</p>
<p>The very night which followed Marnoo's departure, I <reg orig="pro-|ceeded">proceeded</reg> <lb/>
to put this project into execution. About midnight, as I <lb/>
imagined, I rose and drew the slide. The natives, just as I had <lb/>
expected, started up, while some of them asked, "Arware poo <lb/>
awa, Tommo?" (where are you going, Tommo?) "Wai" <lb/>
(water) I laconically answered, grasping the calabash. On <lb/>
hearing my reply they sank back again, and in a minute or two <lb/>
<pb n="267" entity="z000000574_0294" pid="uva-lib:244746"/>
I returned to my mat, anxiously awaiting the result of the <reg orig="ex-|periment">experiment</reg>.</p>
<p>One after another the savages turning restlessly, appeared to <lb/>
resume their slumbers, and rejoicing at the stillness which <reg orig="pre-|vailed">prevailed</reg>, <lb/>
I was about to rise again from my couch, when I heard a <lb/>
slight rustling&mdash;a dark form was intercepted between me and the <lb/>
doorway&mdash;the slide was drawn across it, and the individual, <reg orig="who-|ever">whoever</reg> <lb/>
he was, returned to his mat. This was a sad blow to me; <lb/>
but as it might have roused the suspicions of the islanders to have <lb/>
made another attempt that night, I was reluctantly obliged to <lb/>
defer it until the next. Several times after I repeated the same <lb/>
man&oelig;uvre, but with as little success as before. As my <reg orig="pre-|tence">pretence</reg> <lb/>
for withdrawing from the house was to allay my thirst, <lb/>
Kory-Kory, either suspecting some design on my part, or else <lb/>
prompted by a desire to please me, regularly every evening <lb/>
placed a calabash of water by my side.</p>
<p>Even under these inauspicious circumstances I again and again <lb/>
renewed the attempt; but when I did so my valet always rose <lb/>
with me, as if determined I should not remove myself from his <lb/>
observation. For the present, therefore, I was obliged to <reg orig="aban-|don">abandon</reg> <lb/>
the attempt; but I endeavoured to console myself with the <lb/>
idea that by this mode I might yet effect my escape.</p>
<p>Shortly after Marnoo's visit I was reduced to such a state, <lb/>
that it was with extreme difficulty I could walk, even with the <lb/>
assistance of a spear, and Kory-Kory, as formerly, was obliged <lb/>
to carry me daily to the stream.</p>
<p>For hours and hours during the warmest part of the day I lay <lb/>
upon my mat, and while those around me were nearly all dozing <lb/>
away in careless ease, I remained awake, gloomily pondering <lb/>
over the fate which it appeared now idle for me to resist, when I <lb/>
thought of the loved friends who were thousands and thousands <lb/>
of miles from the savage island in which I was held a captive, <lb/>
when I reflected that my dreadful fate would for ever be <reg orig="con-|cealed">concealed</reg> <lb/>
from them, and that with hope deferred they might <reg orig="con-|tinue">continue</reg> <lb/>
to await my return long after my inanimate form had <lb/>
blended with the dust of the valley&mdash;I could not repress a shudder <lb/>
of anguish.</p>
<p>How vividly is impressed upon my mind every minute feature <lb/>
of the scene which met my view during those long days of <reg orig="suf-|fering">suffering</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="268" entity="z000000574_0295" pid="uva-lib:244747"/>
and sorrow! At my request my mats were always spread <lb/>
directly facing the door, opposite which, and at a little distance, <lb/>
was the hut of boughs that Marheyo was building.</p>
<p>Whenever my gentle Fayaway and Kory-Kory, laying <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
down beside me, would leave me awhile to uninterrupted <lb/>
repose, I took a strange interest in the slightest movements of the <lb/>
eccentric old warrior. All alone during the stillness of the <reg orig="tro-|pical">tropical</reg> <lb/>
mid-day, he would pursue his quiet work, sitting in the shade <lb/>
and weaving together the leaflets of his cocoa-nut branches, or <lb/>
rolling upon his knee the twisted fibres of bark to form the cords <lb/>
with which he tied together the thatching of his tiny house. <lb/>
Frequently suspending his employment, and noticing my <reg orig="melan-|choly">melancholy</reg> <lb/>
eye fixed upon him, he would raise his hand with a gesture <lb/>
expressive of deep commiseration, and then moving towards me <lb/>
slowly would enter on tip-toes, fearful of disturbing the <reg orig="slumber-|ing">slumbering</reg> <lb/>
natives, and, taking the fan from my hand, would sit before <lb/>
me, swaying it gently to and fro, and gazing earnestly into my <lb/>
face.</p>
<p>Just beyond the pi-pi, and disposed in a triangle before the <lb/>
entrance of the house, were three magnificent bread-fruit trees. <lb/>
At this moment I can recal to my mind their slender shafts, and <lb/>
the graceful inequalities of their bark, on which my eye was <reg orig="ac-|customed">accustomed</reg> <lb/>
to dwell day after day in the midst of my solitary <lb/>
musings. It is strange how inanimate objects will twine <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
into our affections, especially in the hour of affliction. <lb/>
Even now, amidst all the bustle and stir of the proud and busy <lb/>
city in which I am dwelling, the image of those three trees seems <lb/>
to come as vividly before my eyes as if they were actually <reg orig="pre-|sent">present</reg>, <lb/>
and I still feel the soothing quiet pleasure which I then had <lb/>
in watching hour after hour their topmost boughs waving <reg orig="grace-|fully">gracefully</reg> <lb/>
in the breeze.</p>

<p rend="center">The Escape.</p>
</argument>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Nearly</hi> three weeks had elapsed since the second visit of <lb/>
Marnoo, and it must have been more than four months since I <lb/>
entered the valley, when one day about noon, and whilst <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg> <lb/>
was in profound silence, Mow-Mow, the one-eyed chief, <lb/>
suddenly appeared at the door, and leaning forward towards me <lb/>
as I lay directly facing him, said in a low tone, "Toby pemi <lb/>
ena" (Toby has arrived here). Gracious heaven! What a <lb/>
tumult of emotions rushed upon me at this startling intelligence! <lb/>
Insensible to the pain that had before distracted me, I leaped to <lb/>
my feet, and called wildly to Kory-Kory, who was reposing by <lb/>
my side. The startled islanders sprang from their mats; the <lb/>
news was quickly communicated to them; and the next moment <lb/>
I was making my way to the Ti on the back of Kory-Kory, and <lb/>
surrounded by the excited savages.</p>
<p>All that I could comprehend of the particulars which <reg orig="Mow-|Mow">Mow-Mow</reg> <lb/>
rehearsed to his auditors as we proceeded, was that my <lb/>
long-lost companion had arrived in a boat which had just entered <lb/>
the bay. These tidings made me most anxious to be carried at <lb/>
once to the sea, lest some untoward circumstance should prevent <lb/>
our meeting; but to this they would not consent, and continued <lb/>
their course towards the royal abode. As we approached it, <lb/>
Mehevi and several chiefs showed themselves from the piazza, and <lb/>
called upon us loudly to come to them.</p>
<p>As soon as we had approached, I endeavoured to make them <lb/>
understand that I was going down to the sea to meet Toby. To <lb/>
this the king objected, and motioned Kory-Kory to bring me <lb/>
into the house. It was in vain to resist; and in a few moments <lb/>
I found myself within the Ti, surrounded by a noisy group <lb/>
engaged in discussing the recent intelligence. Toby's name was <lb/>
frequently repeated, coupled with violent exclamations of <reg orig="as-|tonishment">astonishment</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="270" entity="z000000574_0297" pid="uva-lib:244749"/>
It seemed as if they yet remained in doubt with <lb/>
regard to the fact of his arrival, and at every fresh report <lb/>
that was brought from the shore they betrayed the liveliest <lb/>
emotions.</p>
<p>Almost frenzied at being held in this state of suspense, I <reg orig="pas-|sionately">passionately</reg> <lb/>
besought Mehevi to permit me to proceed. Whether <lb/>
my companion had arrived or not, I felt a presentiment that my <lb/>
own fate was about to be decided. Again and again I renewed <lb/>
my petition to Mehevi. He regarded me with a fixed and serious <lb/>
eye, but at length yielding to my importunity, reluctantly granted <lb/>
my request.</p>
<p>Accompanied by some fifty of the natives, I now rapidly <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
my journey; every few moments being transferred from <lb/>
the back of one to another, and urging my bearer forward all the <lb/>
while with earnest entreaties. As I thus hurried forward, no <lb/>
doubt as to the truth of the information I had received ever <lb/>
crossed my mind. I was alive only to the one overwhelming <lb/>
idea, that a chance of deliverance was now afforded me, if the <lb/>
jealous opposition of the savages could be overcome.</p>
<p>Having been prohibited from approaching the sea during the <lb/>
whole of my stay in the valley, I had always associated with it <lb/>
the idea of escape. Toby too&mdash;if indeed he had ever voluntarily <lb/>
deserted me&mdash;must have effected his flight by the sea; and now <lb/>
that I was drawing near to it myself, I indulged in hopes which <lb/>
I had never felt before. It was evident that a boat had entered <lb/>
the bay, and I saw little reason to doubt the truth of the <lb/>
report that it had brought my companion. Every time therefore <lb/>
that we gained an elevation, I looked eagerly around, hoping to <lb/>
behold him.</p>
<p>In the midst of an excited throng, who by their violent <lb/>
gestures and wild cries appeared to be under the influence of <lb/>
some excitement as strong as my own, I was now borne along at <lb/>
a rapid trot, frequently stooping my head to avoid the branches <lb/>
which crossed the path, and never ceasing to implore those who <lb/>
carried me to accelerate their already swift pace.</p>
<p>In this manner we had proceeded about four or five miles, <lb/>
when we were met by a party of some twenty islanders, between <lb/>
whom and those who accompanied me ensued an animated <reg orig="con-|ference">conference</reg>. <lb/>
Impatient of the delay occasioned by this interruption, <lb/>
<pb n="271" entity="z000000574_0298" pid="uva-lib:244750"/>
I was beseeching the man who carried me to proceed without his <lb/>
loitering companions, when Kory-Kory, running to my side, <reg orig="in-|formed">informed</reg> <lb/>
me, in three fatal words, that the news had all proved <lb/>
false &mdash; that Toby had not arrived &mdash; "Toby owlee permi." <lb/>
Heaven only knows how, in the state of mind and body I then <lb/>
was, I ever sustained the agony which this intelligence caused <lb/>
me: not that the news was altogether unexpected; but I had <lb/>
trusted that the fact might not have been made known until we <lb/>
should have arrived upon the beach. As it was, I at once <reg orig="fore-|saw">foresaw</reg> <lb/>
the course the savages would pursue. They had only <lb/>
yielded thus far to my entreaties, that I might give a joyful <lb/>
welcome to my long-absent comrade; but now that it was known <lb/>
he had not arrived, they would at once oblige me to turn back.</p>
<p>My anticipations were but too correct. In spite of the <reg orig="re-|sistance">resistance</reg> <lb/>
I made, they carried me into a house which was near <lb/>
the spot, and left me upon the mats. Shortly afterwards several <lb/>
of those who had accompanied me from the Ti, detaching <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
from the others, proceeded in the direction of the sea. <lb/>
Those who remained&mdash;among whom were Marheyo, Mow-Mow, <lb/>
Kory-Kory, and Tinor&mdash;gathered about the dwelling and <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
to be awaiting their return.</p>
<p>This convinced me that strangers&mdash;perhaps some of my own <lb/>
countrymen&mdash;had for some cause or other entered the bay. <lb/>
Distracted at the idea of their vicinity, and reckless of the pain <lb/>
which I suffered, I heeded not the assurances of the islanders, <lb/>
that there were no boats at the beach, but starting to my feet <lb/>
endeavoured to gain the door. Instantly the passage was blocked <lb/>
up by several men, who commanded me to resume my seat. The <lb/>
fierce looks of the irritated savages admonished me that I could <lb/>
gain nothing by force, and that it was by entreaty alone that I <lb/>
could hope to compass my object.</p>
<p>Guided by this consideration, I turned to Mow-Mow, the only <lb/>
chief present whom I had been much in the habit of seeing, and <lb/>
carefully concealing my real design, tried to make him <reg orig="com-|prehend">comprehend</reg> <lb/>
that I still believed Toby to have arrived on the shore, <lb/>
and besought him to allow me to go forward to welcome him. <lb/>
To all his repeated assertions, that my companion had not been <lb/>
seen, I pretended to turn a deaf ear: while I urged my <reg orig="solicita-|tions">solicitations</reg> <lb/>
with an eloquence of gesture which the one-eyed chief <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="272" entity="z000000574_0299" pid="uva-lib:244751"/>
unable to resist. He seemed indeed to regard me as a <lb/>
froward child, to whose wishes he had not the heart to oppose <lb/>
force, and whom he must consequently humour. He spoke a <lb/>
few words to the natives, who at once retreated from the door, <lb/>
and immediately passed out of the house.</p>
<p>Here I looked earnestly round for Kory-Kory; but that hitherto <lb/>
faithful servitor was nowhere to be seen. Unwilling to linger <lb/>
even for a single instant when every moment might be so <reg orig="im-|portant">important</reg>, <lb/>
I motioned to a muscular fellow near me to take me <lb/>
upon his back: to my surprise he angrily refused. I turned to <lb/>
another, but with a like result. A third attempt was as <reg orig="unsuc-|cessful">unsuccessful</reg>, <lb/>
and I immediately perceived what had induced <reg orig="Mow-|Mow">Mow-Mow</reg> <lb/>
to grant my request and why the other natives conducted <lb/>
themselves in so strange a manner. It was evident that the chief <lb/>
had only given me liberty to continue my progress towards the <lb/>
sea because he supposed that I was deprived of the means of <lb/>
reaching it.</p>
<p>Convinced by this of their determination to retain me a <reg orig="cap-|tive">captive</reg>, <lb/>
I became desperate; and almost insensible to the pain <lb/>
which I suffered, I seized a spear which was leaning against the <lb/>
projecting eaves of the house, and supporting myself with it, <reg orig="re-|sumed">resumed</reg> <lb/>
the path that swept by the dwelling. To my surprise I <lb/>
was suffered to proceed alone, all the natives remaining in front <lb/>
of the house, and engaging in earnest conversation, which every <lb/>
moment became more loud and vehement; and to my <reg orig="unspeak-|able">unspeakable</reg> <lb/>
delight I perceived that some difference of opinion had <lb/>
arisen between them; that two parties, in short, were formed, and <lb/>
consequently that in their divided counsels there was some chance <lb/>
of my deliverance.</p>
<p>Before I had proceeded a hundred yards I was again surrounded <lb/>
by the savages, who were still in all the heat of argument, <lb/>
and appeared every moment as if they would come to blows. In <lb/>
the midst of this tumult old Marheyo came to my side, and I <lb/>
shall never forget the benevolent expression of his countenance. <lb/>
He placed his arm upon my shoulder, and emphatically <reg orig="pro-|nounced">pronounced</reg> <lb/>
the only two English words I had taught him&mdash;"Home" <lb/>
and "Mother." I at once understood what he meant, and <lb/>
eagerly expressed my thanks to him. Fayaway and <reg orig="Kory-|Kory">Kory-Kory</reg> <lb/>
were by his side, both weeping violently; and it was not <lb/>
<pb n="273" entity="z000000574_0300" pid="uva-lib:244752"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">T</fw></pb>
until the old man had twice repeated the command that his son <lb/>
could bring himself to obey him, and take me again upon his <lb/>
back. The one-eyed chief opposed his doing so, but he was <reg orig="over-|ruled">overruled</reg>, <lb/>
and, as it seemed to me, by some of his own party.</p>
<p>We proceeded onwards, and never shall I forget the extacy I <lb/>
felt when I first heard the roar of the surf breaking upon the <lb/>
beach. Before long I saw the flashing billows themselves through <lb/>
the opening between the trees. Oh glorious sight and sound of <lb/>
ocean! with what rapture did I hail you as familiar friends! <lb/>
By this time the shouts of the crowd upon the beach were <reg orig="dis-|tinctly">distinctly</reg> <lb/>
audible, and in the blended confusion of sounds I almost <lb/>
fancied I could distinguish the voices of my own countrymen.</p>
<p>When we reached the open space which lay between the <lb/>
groves and the sea, the first object that met my view was an <lb/>
English whale-boat, lying with her bow pointed from the shore, <lb/>
and only a few fathoms distant from it. It was manned by five <lb/>
islanders, dressed in short tunics of calico. My first impression <lb/>
was that they were in the very act of pulling out from the bay; <lb/>
and that, after all my exertions, I had come too late. My soul <lb/>
sunk within me: but a second glance convinced me that the boat <lb/>
was only hanging off to keep out of the surf; and the next <lb/>
moment I heard my own name shouted out by a voice from the <lb/>
midst of the crowd.</p>
<p>Looking in the direction of the sound, I perceived, to my <reg orig="in-|describable">indescribable</reg> <lb/>
joy, the tall figure of Karakoee, an Oahu Kannaka, <lb/>
who had often been aboard the `Dolly,' while she lay in <reg orig="Nuku-|heva">Nukuheva</reg>. <lb/>
He wore the green shooting-jacket with gilt buttons, <lb/>
which had been given to him by an officer of the Reine Blanche <lb/>
&mdash;the French flag-ship&mdash;and in which I had always seen him <lb/>
dressed. I now remembered the Kannaka had frequently told <lb/>
me that his person was tabooed in all the valleys of the island, <lb/>
and the sight of him at such a moment as this filled my heart <lb/>
with a tumult of delight.</p>
<p>Karakoee stood near the edge of the water with a large roll of <lb/>
cotton cloth thrown over one arm, and holding two or three <reg orig="can-|vass">canvass</reg> <lb/>
bags of powder; while with the other hand he grasped a <lb/>
musket, which he appeared to be proffering to several of the <lb/>
chiefs around him. But they turned with disgust from his offers, <lb/>
and seemed to be impatient at his presence, with vehement <lb/>
<pb n="274" entity="z000000574_0301" pid="uva-lib:244753"/>
gestures waving him off to his boat, and commanding him to <lb/>
depart.</p>
<p>The Kannaka, however, still maintained his ground, and I at <lb/>
once perceived that he was seeking to purchase my freedom. <lb/>
Animated by the idea, I called upon him loudly to come to me; <lb/>
but he replied, in broken English, that the islanders had <reg orig="threat-|ened">threatened</reg> <lb/>
to pierce him with their spears, if he stirred a foot towards <lb/>
me. At this time I was still advancing, surrounded by a dense <lb/>
throng of the natives, several of whom had their hands upon me, <lb/>
and more than one javelin was threateningly pointed at me. <lb/>
Still I perceived clearly that many of those least friendly towards <lb/>
me looked irresolute and anxious.</p>
<p>I was still some thirty yards from Karakoee when my farther <lb/>
progress was prevented by the natives, who compelled me to sit <lb/>
down upon the ground, while they still retained their hold upon <lb/>
my arms. The din and tumult now became tenfold, and I <reg orig="per-|ceived">perceived</reg> <lb/>
that several of the priests were on the spot, all of whom <lb/>
were evidently urging Mow-Mow and the other chiefs to prevent <lb/>
my departure; and the detestable word "Roo-ne! Roo-ne!" <lb/>
which I had heard repeated a thousand times during the day, was <lb/>
now shouted out on every side of me. Still I saw that the <lb/>
Kannaka continued his exertions in my favour&mdash;that he was <lb/>
boldly debating the matter with the savages, and was striving to <lb/>
entice them by displaying his cloth and powder, and snapping the <lb/>
lock of his musket. But all he said or did appeared only to <reg orig="aug-|ment">augment</reg> <lb/>
the clamours of those around him, who seemed bent upon <lb/>
driving him into the sea.</p>
<p>When I remembered the extravagant value placed by these <lb/>
people upon the articles which were offered to them in exchange <lb/>
for me, and which were so indignantly rejected, I saw a new <lb/>
proof of the same fixed determination of purpose they had all <lb/>
along manifested with regard to me, and in despair, and reckless of <lb/>
consequences, I exerted all my strength, and shaking myself free <lb/>
from the grasp of those who held me, I sprung upon my feet and <lb/>
rushed towards Karakoee.</p>
<p>The rash attempt nearly decided my fate; for, fearful that I <lb/>
might slip from them, several of the islanders now raised a <reg orig="simul-|taneous">simultaneous</reg> <lb/>
shout, and pressing upon Karakoee, they menaced him <lb/>
with furious gestures, and actually forced him into the sea. <lb/>
<pb n="275" entity="z000000574_0302" pid="uva-lib:244754"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-right">T 2</fw></pb>
Appalled at their violence, the poor fellow, standing nearly to <lb/>
the waist in the surf, endeavoured to pacify them; but at length, <lb/>
fearful that they would do him some fatal violence, he beckoned <lb/>
to his comrades to pull in at once, and take him into the boat.</p>
<p>It was at this agonizing moment, when I thought all hope <lb/>
was ended, that a new contest arose between the two parties <lb/>
who had accompanied me to the shore; blows were struck, <lb/>
wounds were given, and blood flowed. In the interest <reg orig="ex-|cited">excited</reg> <lb/>
by the fray, every one had left me except Marheyo, <reg orig="Kory-|Kory">Kory-Kory</reg>, <lb/>
and poor dear Fayaway, who clung to me, sobbing <lb/>
indignantly. I saw that now or never was the moment. <reg orig="Clasp-|ing">Clasping</reg> <lb/>
my hands together, I looked imploringly at Marheyo, and <lb/>
moved towards the now almost deserted beach. The tears were <lb/>
in the old man's eyes, but neither he nor Kory-Kory attempted to <lb/>
hold me, and I soon reached the Kannaka, who had been anxiously <lb/>
watching my movements; the rowers pulled in as near as they <lb/>
dared to the edge of the surf; I gave one parting embrace to <lb/>
Fayaway, who seemed speechless with sorrow, and the next instant <lb/>
I found myself safe in the boat, and Karakoee by my side, who <lb/>
told the rowers at once to give way. Marheyo and Kory-Kory, <lb/>
and a great many of the women, followed me into the water, and <lb/>
I was determined, as the only mark of gratitude I could show, to <lb/>
give them the articles which had been brought as my ransom. I <lb/>
handed the musket to Kory-Kory, with a rapid gesture which was <lb/>
equivalent to a "Deed of Gift;" threw the roll of cotton to old <lb/>
Marheyo, pointing as I did so to poor Fayaway, who had retired <lb/>
from the edge of the water and was sitting down disconsolate on <lb/>
the shingles; and tumbled the powder-bags out to the nearest <lb/>
young ladies, all of whom were vastly willing to take them. <lb/>
This distribution did not occupy ten seconds, and before it was <lb/>
over the boat was under full way; the Kannaka all the while <reg orig="ex-|claiming">exclaiming</reg> <lb/>
loudly against what he considered a useless throwing <lb/>
away of valuable property.</p>
<p>Although it was clear that my movements had been noticed by <lb/>
several of the natives, still they had not suspended the conflict in <lb/>
which they were engaged, and it was not until the boat was above <lb/>
fifty yards from the shore that Mow-Mow and some six or seven <lb/>
other warriors rushed into the sea and hurled their javelins at us. <lb/>
Some of the weapons passed quite as close to us as was desirable, <lb/>
<pb n="276" entity="z000000574_0303" pid="uva-lib:244755"/>
but no one was wounded, and the men pulled away gallantly. <lb/>
But although soon out of the reach of the spears, our progress <lb/>
was extremely slow; it blew strong upon the shore, and the tide <lb/>
was against us; and I saw Karakoee, who was steering the boat, <lb/>
give many a look towards a jutting point of the bay round which <lb/>
we had to pass.</p>
<p>For a minute or two after our departure, the savages, who had <lb/>
formed into different groups, remained perfectly motionless and <lb/>
silent. All at once the enraged chief showed by his gestures <lb/>
that he had resolved what course he would take. Shouting <lb/>
loudly to his companions, and pointing with his tomahawk <lb/>
towards the headland, he set off at full speed in that direction, <lb/>
and was followed by about thirty of the natives, among whom <lb/>
were several of the priests, all yelling out "Roo-ne! Roo-ne!" <lb/>
at the very top of their voices. Their intention was evidently <lb/>
to swim off from the headland and interrupt us in our course. <lb/>
The wind was freshening every minute, and was right in our <lb/>
teeth, and it was one of those chopping angry seas in which it is <lb/>
so difficult to row. Still the chances seemed in our favour, but <lb/>
when we came within a hundred yards of the point, the active <lb/>
savages were already dashing into the water, and we all feared <lb/>
that within five minutes' time we should have a score of the <reg orig="in-|furiated">infuriated</reg> <lb/>
wretches around us. If so, our doom was sealed, for <lb/>
these savages, unlike the feeble swimmers of civilized countries, <lb/>
are, if anything, more formidable antagonists in the water than <lb/>
when on the land. It was all a trial of strength; our natives pulled <lb/>
till their oars bent again, and the crowd of swimmers shot through <lb/>
the water despite its roughness, with fearful rapidity.</p>
<p>By the time we had reached the headland, the savages were <lb/>
spread right across our course. Our rowers got out their knives <lb/>
and held them ready between their teeth, and I seized the <reg orig="boat-|hook">boathook</reg>. <lb/>
We were well aware that if they succeeded in <reg orig="inter-|cepting">intercepting</reg> <lb/>
us they would practise upon us the man&oelig;uvre which <lb/>
has proved so fatal to many a boat's crew in these seas. They <lb/>
would grapple the oars, and seizing hold of the gunwale, capsize <lb/>
the boat, and then we should be entirely at their mercy.</p>
<p>After a few breathless moments I discerned Mow-Mow. The <lb/>
athletic islander, with his tomahawk between his teeth, was <lb/>
dashing the water before him till it foamed again. He was the <lb/>
<pb n="277" entity="z000000574_0304" pid="uva-lib:244756"/>
nearest to us, and in another instant he would have seized one of <lb/>
the oars. Even at the moment I felt horror at the act I was <lb/>
about to commit; but it was no time for pity or compunction, <lb/>
and with a true aim, and exerting all my strength, I dashed the <lb/>
boat-hook at him. It struck him just below the throat, and <lb/>
forced him downwards. I had no time to repeat my blow, but I <lb/>
saw him rise to the surface in the wake of the boat, and never <lb/>
shall I forget the ferocious expression of his countenance.</p>
<p>Only one other of the savages reached the boat. He seized <lb/>
the gunwale, but the knives of our rowers so mauled his wrists, <lb/>
that he was forced to quit his hold, and the next minute we were <lb/>
past them all, and in safety. The strong excitement which had <lb/>
thus far kept me up, now left me, and I fell back fainting into <lb/>
the arms of Karakoee.</p>
<ornament type="characters">*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*</ornament>
<p>The circumstances connected with my most unexpected escape <lb/>
may be very briefly stated. The captain of an Australian vessel, <lb/>
being in distress for men in these remote seas, had put into <reg orig="Nu-|kuheva">Nukuheva</reg> <lb/>
in order to recruit his ship's company; but not a single <lb/>
man was to be obtained; and the barque was about to get under <lb/>
weigh, when she was boarded by Karakoee, who informed the <lb/>
disappointed Englishman that an American sailor was detained <lb/>
by the savages in the neighbouring bay of Typee; and he offered, <lb/>
if supplied with suitable articles of traffic, to undertake his <reg orig="re-|lease">release</reg>. <lb/>
The Kannaka had gained his intelligence from Marnoo, to <lb/>
whom, after all, I was indebted for my escape. The proposition <lb/>
was acceded to; and Karakoee, taking with him five tabooed <lb/>
natives of Nukuheva, again repaired aboard the barque, which in <lb/>
a few hours sailed to that part of the island, and threw her <reg orig="main-|top-sail">main-top-sail</reg> <lb/>
aback right off the entrance to the Typee bay. The <lb/>
whale-boat, manned by the tabooed crew, pulled towards the <lb/>
head of the inlet, while the ship lay "off and on" awaiting its <lb/>
return.</p>
<p>The events which ensued have already been detailed, and little <lb/>
more remains to be related. On reaching the `Julia' I was lifted <lb/>
over the side, and my strange appearance and remarkable <reg orig="adven-|ture">adventure</reg> <lb/>
occasioned the liveliest interest. Every attention was <reg orig="be-|stowed">bestowed</reg> <lb/>
upon me that humanity could suggest. But to such a <lb/>
<pb n="278" entity="z000000574_0305" pid="uva-lib:244757"/>
state was I reduced, that three months elapsed before I recovered <lb/>
my health.</p>
<p>The mystery which hung over the fate of my friend and <reg orig="com-|panion">companion</reg> <lb/>
Toby has never been cleared up. I still remain ignorant <lb/>
whether he succeeded in leaving the valley, or perished at the <lb/>
hands of the islanders.</p>

<ornament type="line"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> author of this volume arrived at Tahiti the very day that the <lb/>
iniquitous designs of the French were consummated by inducing the <lb/>
subordinate chiefs, during the absence of their queen, to ratify an <reg orig="art-|fully">artfully</reg> <lb/>
drawn treaty, by which she was virtually deposed. Both <reg orig="me-|naces">menaces</reg> <lb/>
and caresses were employed on this occasion, and the 32-pounders <lb/>
which peeped out of the portholes of the frigate were the principal <lb/>
arguments adduced to quiet the scruples of the more conscientious <lb/>
islanders.</p>
<p>And yet this piratical seizure of Tahiti, with all the woe and <reg orig="deso-|lation">desolation</reg> <lb/>
which resulted from it, created not half so great a sensation, at <lb/>
least in America, as was caused by the proceedings of the English at <lb/>
the Sandwich Islands. No transaction has ever been more grossly <reg orig="mis-|represented">misrepresented</reg> <lb/>
than the events which occurred upon the arrival of Lord <lb/>
George Paulet at Oahu. During a residence of four months at <reg orig="Hono-|lulu">Honolulu</reg>, <lb/>
the metropolis of the group, the author was in the confidence <lb/>
of an Englishman who was much employed by his lordship; and great <lb/>
was the author's astonishment on his arrival at Boston, in the autumn <lb/>
of 1844, to read the distorted accounts and fabrications which had <lb/>
produced in the United States so violent an outbreak of indignation <lb/>
against the English. He deems it, therefore, a mere act of justice <lb/>
towards a gallant officer briefly to state the leading circumstances <reg orig="con-|nected">connected</reg> <lb/>
with the event in question.</p>
<p>It is needless to rehearse all the abuse that for some time previous to <lb/>
the spring of 1843 had been heaped upon the British residents, <reg orig="espe-|cially">especially</reg> <lb/>
upon Captain Charlton, her Britannic Majesty's consul-general, <lb/>
by the native authorities of the Sandwich Islands. High in the favour <lb/>
of the imbecile king at this time was one Dr. Judd, a sanctimonious <lb/>
apothecary-adventurer, who, with other kindred and influential spirits, <lb/>
were animated by an inveterate dislike to England. The ascendancy of <lb/>
<pb n="282" entity="z000000574_0309" pid="uva-lib:244761"/>
a junto of ignorant and designing Methodist elders in the councils of <lb/>
a half-civilized king, ruling with absolute sway over a nation just poised <lb/>
between barbarism and civilization, and exposed by the peculiarities of <lb/>
its relations with foreign states to unusual difficulties, was not precisely <lb/>
calculated to impart a healthy tone to the policy of the government.</p>
<p>At last matters were brought to such an extremity, through the <reg orig="ini-|quitous">iniquitous</reg> <lb/>
maladministration of affairs, that the endurance of further <lb/>
insults and injuries on the part of the British consul was no longer to be <lb/>
borne. Captain Charlton, insultingly forbidden to leave the islands, <lb/>
clandestinely withdrew, and arriving at Valaparaiso, conferred with <lb/>
Rear-Admiral Thomas, the English commander-in-chief on the Pacific <lb/>
station. In consequence of this communication, Lord George Paulet <lb/>
was despatched by the admiral in the Carysfort frigate, to enquire into <lb/>
and correct the alleged abuses. On arriving at his destination, he <lb/>
sent his first-lieutenant ashore with a letter to the king, couched in <lb/>
terms of the utmost courtesy, and soliciting the honour of an audience. <lb/>
The messenger was denied access to his Majesty, and Paulet was coolly <lb/>
referred to Doctor Judd, and informed that the apothecary was invested <lb/>
with plenary powers to treat with him. Rejecting this insolent <reg orig="propo-|sition">proposition</reg>, <lb/>
his lordship again addressed the king by letter, and renewed his <lb/>
previous request; but he encountered another repulse. Justly <reg orig="indig-|nant">indignant</reg> <lb/>
at this treatment, he penned a third epistle, enumerating the <lb/>
grievances to be redressed, and demanding a compliance with his <reg orig="requi-|sitions">requisitions</reg>, <lb/>
under penalty of immediate hostilities.</p>
<p>The government was now obliged to act, and an artful stroke of <lb/>
policy was decided upon by the despicable counsellors of the king to <lb/>
entrap the sympathies and rouse the indignation of Christendom. His <lb/>
Majesty was made to intimate to the British captain that he could not, <lb/>
as the conscientious ruler of his beloved people, comply with the <lb/>
arbitrary demands of his lordship, and in deprecation of the horrors of <lb/>
war, tendered to his acceptance the "provisional cession" of the islands, <lb/>
subject to the result of the negotiations then pending in London. <lb/>
Paulet, a bluff and straight-forward sailor, took the king at his word, <lb/>
and after some preliminary arrangements, entered upon the <reg orig="adminis-|tration">administration</reg> <lb/>
of Hawiian affairs, in the same firm and benignant spirit which <lb/>
marked the discipline of his frigate, and which had rendered him the <lb/>
idol of his ship's company. He soon endeared himself to nearly all <lb/>
orders of the islanders; but the king and the chiefs, whose feudal sway <lb/>
<pb n="283" entity="z000000574_0310" pid="uva-lib:244762"/>
over the common people is laboriously sought to be perpetuated by <lb/>
their missionary advisers, regarded all his proceedings with the most <lb/>
vigilant animosity. Jealous of his growing popularity, and unable to <lb/>
counteract it, they endeavoured to assail his reputation abroad by <reg orig="osten-|tatiously">ostentatiously</reg> <lb/>
protesting against his acts, and appealing in Oriental phrase <lb/>
to the <hi rend="italic">wide universe</hi> to witness and compassionate their <hi rend="italic">unparalleled <lb/>
wrongs.</hi></p>
<p>Heedless of their idle clamours, Lord George Paulet addressed <lb/>
himself to the task of reconciling the differences among the foreign <lb/>
residents, remedying their grievances, promoting their mercantile <lb/>
interests, and ameliorating as far as lay in his power the condition of <lb/>
the degraded natives. The iniquities he brought to light and instantly <lb/>
suppressed are too numerous to be here recorded; but one instance may <lb/>
be mentioned that will give some idea of the lamentable misrule to <lb/>
which these poor islanders are subjected.</p>
<p>It is well known that the laws at the Sandwich Islands are subject to <lb/>
the most capricious alterations, which, by confounding all ideas of right <lb/>
and wrong in the minds of the natives, produce the most pernicious <lb/>
effects. In no case is this mischief more plainly discernible than in the <lb/>
continually shifting regulations concerning licentiousness. At one time <lb/>
the most innocent freedoms between the sexes are punished with fine <lb/>
and imprisonment; at another the revocation of the statute is followed <lb/>
by the most open and undisguised profligacy.</p>
<p>It so happened that at the period of Paulet's arrival the Connecticut <lb/>
blue laws had been for at least three weeks steadily enforced. In <reg orig="con-|sequence">consequence</reg> <lb/>
of this, the fort at Honolulu was filled with a great number of <lb/>
young girls, who were confined there doing penance for their slips from <lb/>
virtue. Paulet, although at first unwilling to interfere with regulations <lb/>
having reference solely to the natives themselves, was eventually, by the <lb/>
prevalence of certain reports, induced to institute a strict inquiry into <lb/>
the internal administration of General Kekuanoa, governor of the <lb/>
island of Oahu, one of the pillars of the Hawiian church, and captain <lb/>
of the fort. He soon ascertained that numbers of the young females <lb/>
employed during the day at work intended for the benefit of the king, <lb/>
were at night smuggled over the ramparts of the fort&mdash;which on one <lb/>
side directly overhangs the sea&mdash;and were conveyed by stealth on board <lb/>
such vessels as had contracted with the General to be supplied with <lb/>
them. Before daybreak they returned to their quarters, and their own <lb/>
<pb n="284" entity="z000000574_0311" pid="uva-lib:244763"/>
silence with regard to these secret excursions was purchased by a small <lb/>
portion of those wages of iniquity which were placed in the hands of <lb/>
Kekuanoa.</p>
<p>The vigour with which the laws concerning licentiousness were at <lb/>
that period enforced, enabled the General to monopolize in a great <reg orig="mea-|sure">measure</reg> <lb/>
the detestable trade in which he was engaged, and there <reg orig="conse-|quently">consequently</reg> <lb/>
flowed into his coffers&mdash;and some say into those of the <reg orig="govern-|ment">government</reg> <lb/>
also&mdash;considerable sums of money. It is indeed a lamentable fact, <lb/>
that the principal revenue of the Hawiian government is derived from <lb/>
the fines levied upon, or rather the licences taken out by Vice, the <lb/>
prosperity of which is linked with that of the government. Were the <lb/>
people to become virtuous the authorities would become poor; but from <lb/>
present indications there is little apprehension to be entertained on that <lb/>
score.</p>
<p>Some five months after the date of the cession, the Dublin frigate, <lb/>
carrying the flag of Rear-Admiral Thomas, entered the harbour of <lb/>
Honolulu. The excitement that her sudden appearance produced on <lb/>
shore was prodigious. Three days after her arrival an English sailor <lb/>
hauled down the red cross which had been flying from the heights of <lb/>
the fort, and the Hawiian colours were again displayed upon the same <lb/>
staff. At the same moment the long 42-pounders upon Punchbowl Hill <lb/>
opened their iron throats in triumphant reply to the thunders of the <lb/>
five men-of-war in the harbour; and King Kammahamaha III., <reg orig="sur-|rounded">surrounded</reg> <lb/>
by a splendid group of British and American officers, unfurled <lb/>
the royal standard to assembled thousands of his subjects, who, attracted <lb/>
by the imposing military display of the foreigners, had flocked to witness <lb/>
the formal restoration of the islands to their ancient rulers.</p>
<p>The Admiral, after sanctioning the proceedings of his subaltern, had <lb/>
brought the authorities to terms; and so removed the necessity of acting <lb/>
any longer under the provisional cession.</p>
<p>The event was made an occasion of riotous rejoicing by the king and <lb/>
the principal chiefs, who easily secured a display of enthusiasm from the <lb/>
inferior orders, by remitting for a time the accustomed severity of the <lb/>
laws. Royal proclamations in English and Hawiian were placarded in <lb/>
the streets of Honolulu, and posted up in the more populous villages <lb/>
of the group, in which his Majesty announced to his loving subjects the <lb/>
re-establishment of his throne, and called upon them to celebrate it by <lb/>
breaking through all moral, legal, and religious restraint for ten <reg orig="conse-|cutive">consecutive</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="285" entity="z000000574_0312" pid="uva-lib:244764"/>
days, during which time all the laws of the land were solemnly <lb/>
declared to be suspended.</p>
<p>Who that happened to be at Honolulu during those ten memorable <lb/>
days will ever forget them! The spectacle of universal broad-day <lb/>
debauchery, which was then exhibited, beggars description. The natives <lb/>
of the surrounding islands flocked to Honolulu by hundreds, and the <lb/>
crews of two frigates, opportunely let loose like so many demons to swell <lb/>
the heathenish uproar, gave the crowning flourish to the scene. It was <lb/>
a sort of Polynesian saturnalia. Deeds too atrocious to be mentioned <lb/>
were done at noon-day in the open street, and some of the islanders <lb/>
caught in the very act of stealing from the foreigners, were, on being <lb/>
taken to the fort by the aggrieved party, suffered immediately to go at <lb/>
large and to retain the stolen property&mdash;Kekuanoa informing the white <lb/>
men, with a sardonic grin, that the laws were "hannapa" (tied up).</p>
<p>The history of these ten days reveals in their true colours the <reg orig="cha-|racter">character</reg> <lb/>
of the Sandwich islanders, and furnishes an eloquent commentary <lb/>
on the results which have flowed from the labours of the missionaries. <lb/>
Freed from the restraints of severe penal laws, the natives almost to a <lb/>
man had plunged voluntarily into every species of wickedness and <reg orig="ex-|cess">excess</reg>, <lb/>
and by their utter disregard of all decency plainly showed, that <lb/>
although they had been schooled into a seeming submission to the new <lb/>
order of things, they were in reality as depraved and vicious as ever.</p>
<p>Such were the events which produced in America so general an <reg orig="out-|break">outbreak</reg> <lb/>
of indignation against the spirited and high-minded Paulet. He <lb/>
is not the first man who, in the fearless discharge of his duty, has <lb/>
awakened the senseless clamours of those whose narrow-minded suspicions <lb/>
blind them to a proper appreciation of measures which unusual <reg orig="exigen-|cies">exigencies</reg> <lb/>
may have rendered necessary.</p>
<p>It is almost needless to add that the British cabinet never had any <lb/>
idea of appropriating the islands; and it furnishes a sufficient <reg orig="vindi-|cation">vindication</reg> <lb/>
of the acts of Lord George Paulet, that he not only received <lb/>
the unqualified approbation of his own government, but that to this <lb/>
hour the great body of the Hawiian people invoke blessings on his <lb/>
head, and look back with gratitude to the time when his liberal and <lb/>
paternal sway diffused peace and happiness among them.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Published Monthly. Post</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">vo,</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d.,</hi></p>
<p>PRINTED in good readable type, on superfine paper, and <lb/>
designed to furnish all classes of Readers with the <hi rend="italic">highest <lb/>
Literature of the day,</hi> consisting partly of <hi rend="small-caps">original Works,</hi> and <lb/>
partly of new editions of <hi rend="small-caps">popular Publications,</hi> at the <hi rend="italic">lowest <reg orig="pos-|sible">possible</reg> <lb/>
price.</hi> It is called for in consequence of the Acts which <lb/>
have recently passed the British Parliament for the protection of <lb/>
the rights of British authors and publishers, by the rigid and <lb/>
entire exclusion of foreign pirated editions.</p>
<p>In order, therefore, that the highly intelligent and educated <lb/>
population of our Colonies may not suffer from the withdrawal <lb/>
of their accustomed supplies of books, and with a view to obviate <lb/>
the complaint, that a check might in consequence be raised to <lb/>
their intellectual advancement, Mr. Murray has determined to <lb/>
publish a series of attractive and useful works, by approved <lb/>
authors, at a rate which shall place them within the reach of the <lb/>
means not only of the Colonists, but also of a large portion of the <lb/>
less wealthy classes at home, who will thus benefit by the <reg orig="widen-|ing">widening</reg> <lb/>
of the market for our literature: and the "Colonial Library" <lb/>
will consequently be so conducted that it may claim to be <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg> <lb/>
as a "Library for the Empire."</p>
<p>Mr. Murray's "Colonial Library" will furnish the settler in <lb/>
the Backwoods of America, and the occupant of the remotest <lb/>
cantonments of our Indian dominions, with the resources of <lb/>
recreation and instruction, at a moderate price, together with many <lb/>
new books within a short period of their appearance in England; <lb/>
while the student and lover of literature at home, who has <lb/>
hitherto been content with the loan of a book from a book club, <lb/>
or a circulating library, may now become possessed of the work <lb/>
itself, at a cost a little beyond that entailed by either of the <lb/>
methods above mentioned.</p>
<p>The series of Works designed to appear in Mr. Murray's <lb/>
"Colonial and Home Library" will be selected for their <reg orig="acknow-|ledged">acknowledged</reg> <lb/>
merit, and will be exclusively such as are calculated to <lb/>
please the most extensive circle of readers.</p>
