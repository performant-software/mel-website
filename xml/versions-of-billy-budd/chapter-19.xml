To an immature nature essentially honest and humane, forewarning intimations of subtler danger from one's kind come tardily if at all. The only thing that took shape in the young sailor's mind was this: Yes, the Captain, I have always thought, looks kindly upon me. Wonder if he's going to make me his coxswain. I should like that. And may be now he is going to ask the master-at-arms about me. <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0525.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16249"/></p>

<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">"Shut the door there, sentry," said the commander; "stand without, and let nobody come in.—Now, master-at-arms, tell this man to his face what you told of him to me"; and stood prepared to scrutinize the mutually confronting visages.  <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0529.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16255"/> <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0527.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16245"/> With the measured step and calm collected air of an asylum-physician approaching in the public hall some patient beginning to show indications of a coming paroxysm, Claggart <choice ><orig>deliberatly</orig><reg>deliberately</reg></choice> advanced within short range of Billy, and mesmerically looking him in the eye, briefly recapitulated the accusation. <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0533.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16267"/>

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Not at first did Billy take it in. When he did, the rose-tan of his cheek looked struck as by white leprosy. He stood like one impaled and gagged. Meanwhile the <choice ><orig>accuser&#x27; (no possessive s)</orig><reg>accuser's</reg></choice> eyes removing not as yet from the blue dilated ones, underwent a phenomenal change, their wonted rich violet color blurring into a muddy purple. Those lights of human intelligence losing human expression, gelidly protruding like the alien eyes of certain uncatalogued creatures of the deep.     <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0531.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16259"/> The first mesmeristic glance was one of serpent fascination; the last was as the paralyzing lurch of the torpedo-fish. <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0535.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16269"/>

Later, Melville revised in pencil: he deleted "of" and added "at" and inserted "unearthly glance," which words he deleted separately, replacing them with "eyes" (neglecting to revise "accuser" to the possessive "accuser's"). The revision effectively places the horror not innately in Claggart but in Billy's perception.  However, Melville also deleted "at" without restoring "of" so that the revision is uncompleted.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Though at the time Captain Vere was quite <choice ><orig>ignonrant</orig><reg>ignorant</reg></choice> of Billy's liability to vocal impediment, he now <choice ><orig>immediatly</orig><reg>immediately</reg></choice> divined it, since vividly Billy's aspect recalled to him that of a bright young schoolmate of his whom he had once seen struck by much the same <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0539.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16233"/> startling impotence in the act of eagerly rising in the class to be foremost in <choice ><orig>responce</orig><reg>response</reg></choice> to a testing question put to it by the master. Going close up to the young sailor, and laying a soothing hand on his shoulder, he <choice ><orig>said (no comma in MS)</orig><reg>said,</reg></choice> "There is no hurry, my boy. Take your time, take your time." Contrary to the effect intended, these words so fatherly in tone, doubtless touching Billy's heart to the quick, prompted yet more violent efforts at utterance—efforts soon ending for the time in confirming the paralysis, and bringing to his face an expression which was as a crucifixion to behold. The next <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0541.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16277"/> instant, quick as the flame from a discharged cannon at night, his right arm shot out, and Claggart dropped to the deck. Whether intentionally or but owing to the young athlete's superior height, the blow had taken effect full upon the <choice ><orig>forhead</orig><reg>forehead</reg></choice>, so shapely and intellectual-looking a feature in the Master-at-arms; so that the body fell over lengthwise, like a heavy plank tilted from erectness. A gasp or two, and he lay motionless.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">"Fated boy," breathed Captain Vere in tone so low as to be almost a whisper, "what have you done! But here, help me." <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0543.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16281"/>

Regaining erectness Captain Vere with one hand covering his face stood to all appearance as impassive as the object at his feet. Was he absorbed in taking in all the bearings of the event and what was best not only now at once to be done, but also in the sequel? Slowly he uncovered his face; and the effect was as if the moon emerging from eclipse should reappear with quite another <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0545.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16283"/> aspect than that which had gone into hiding. The father in him, manifested towards Billy thus far in the scene, was replaced by the military disciplinarian. In his official tone he bade the foretopman retire to a state-room aft, (pointing it <choice ><orig>out,)</orig><reg>out),</reg></choice> and there remain till thence summoned. This order Billy in silence mechanically obeyed. Then going to the cabin-door where it opened on the quarter-deck, Captain Vere said to the sentry without, "Tell somebody to send Albert here." When the lad appeared his master so contrived it that he should not catch sight of the  prone one. "Albert," he said to him, <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0547.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16285"/> "tell the Surgeon I wish to see him.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The Surgeon looked, and for all his self-command, somewhat started at the abrupt revelation. On Claggart's always pallid complexion, thick black blood was now oozing from nostril and ear. To the gazer's professional eye it was unmistakably no living man that he saw.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">"Is it so <choice ><orig>then?

However, Melville neglected to change his period to a comma. Regardless of punctuation, Melville's revision has created a dangling modifier. </note></reg></choice> who now looking up in <choice ><orig>unfeined</orig><reg>unfeigned</reg></choice> concern, cast a look of intense <choice ><orig>inquisitivness</orig><reg>inquisitiveness</reg></choice> upon his superior. <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0551.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16289"/> But Captain Vere, with one hand to his brow, was standing motionless. Suddenly, catching <choice ><orig>the the</orig><reg>the</reg></choice> Surgeon's arm convulsively, he exclaimed, pointing down to the body–"It is the divine judgement on Ananias! <choice ><orig> Look![no quote]</orig><reg>Look!"</reg></choice>

But "Indomitable" as an adjective—in this case the Surgeon's ironic descriptor for his otherwise unflappable, unexciteable, and "indomitable" captain—is a viable though remote option.</note></reg></choice> Captain, and as yet wholly ignorant of the affair, the prudent Surgeon nevertheless held his peace, only again looking an earnest interrogatory as to what it was that had resulted in such a tragedy. <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0553.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/16227"/>
