</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">An Episode by the way —

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Can it be the phenomenon, disowned or at least conceded not acknowledged, that in some criminal cases puzzles the courts? For this cause have our juries at times not only to endure the prolonged contentions of lawyers with their fees, but also the yet more perplexing strife of the medical experts with theirs? — <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0802.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/18593"/>But why leave it to them? why not subpoena as well the clerical proficients? Their vocation <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0804.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/18595"/>bringing them into peculiar contact with so many human beings, and sometimes in their least guarded hour, in interviews very much more confidential than those of physcian and patient; this would seem to qualify them to know something about those intricacies involved in the question of moral responsibility; whether in a given case, say, the crime proceeded from  mania in the brain or rabies of the heart. As to any differences among themselves these clerical proficients might develop on the stand, these could hardly be greater than the direct contradictions exchanged between the remunerated medical experts.

Yes, the young mute&apos;s blow, an athlete&apos;s, a blow <orig regularizedText="elecrically">electrically</orig> energized by the spasm of his heart, unintentionally had had upon its object the all but instantanious operation of the divine judgement on Annannias.

</p><p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Captain Vere intently watching the Surgeon&apos;s face, asked, &quot;Is it so then? I thought it. But verify it.&quot; And the customary tests were made, confirming the Surgeon&apos;s first glance. <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0808.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/18600"/>
