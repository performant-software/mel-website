And the circumstances that provoke it, however trivial or mean, are no measure of its power. In the present instance the stage is a scrubbed gun-deck, and one of the external provocations a man-of-war's-man's spilled soup.</p>

<p>Now when the Master-at-arms noticed whence came that greasy fluid streaming before his feet, he must have taken it—to some extent <ref target="#BB13Note1">wilfully</ref><note xml:id="BB13Note1">Beneath "wilfully", in the bottom margin of leaf image 346, Melville's penciled instruction "Insert afterwards" is preceded by the false start "n", which HS and NN transcribe as undeciphered.</note>, <pb facs="https://iiif.archivengine.com/iiif/3/3imatay0f1v96v7cifhn9l9yfn7k;1" corresp="img_348" /> perhaps—not for the mere accident it assuredly was, but for the sly escape of a spontaneous feeling on Billy's part more or less answering to the antipathy on his own. In effect a foolish demonstration, he must have thought, and very harmless, like the futile kick of a heifer, which yet were <ref target="#ref_29862"><choice><orig>heifer ("the" in MS deleted)</orig><reg>the heifer</reg></choice></ref><note xml:id="ref_29862">heifer] Melville wrote "the cow" first, crossed out the phrase, wrote "heifer" above the line, crossed it out, then restored it, not thinking to restore his deleted "the."</note> a shod stallion, would not be so harmless. Even so was it that into the gall of Claggart's envy he infused the vitriol of his contempt. <pb facs="https://iiif.archivengine.com/iiif/3/jyobw5gyui8ftu619sbdx05r35yx;1" corresp="img_350" /> But <choice><orig>The</orig><reg>the</reg></choice> incident confirmed to him certain tell-tale reports purveyed to his ear by <hi rend="italic">Squeak</hi>, one of his more cunning Corporals, <ref target="#ref_28909">a</ref><note xml:id="ref_28909">a] a a (MS).

MEL deletes the unnecessary "a."</note> grizzled little man, so nicknamed by the sailors on account of his squeaky voice, and sharp visage ferreting about the dark corners of the lower decks after interlopers, satirically suggesting to them the idea of a rat in a cellar. <pb facs="https://iiif.archivengine.com/iiif/3/zundyy3qesghzwa1towo8ryy8bms;1" corresp="img_352" />

</p><p>From his Chief's employing him as an implicit tool in laying little traps for the worriment of the Foretopman,—for it was from the Master-at-arms that the petty persecutions heretofore adverted to had proceeded—the Corporal having naturally enough concluded that his master could have no love for the sailor, made it his business, faithful <ref target="#ref_29866">understrapper</ref><note xml:id="ref_29866">understrapper] Originally in MS, HM had set off the appositive phrase "faithful understrapper" with commas.

The Master-at-arms never suspected the veracity of these reports, more especially as to the epithets, for he well knew how secretly unpopular may become a <choice><orig>master-at-arms (no comma in MS)</orig><reg>master-at-arms,</reg></choice> at least a master-at-arms of those days zealous in his function, and how the blue-jackets shoot at him in private their raillery and wit; the nickname by which he goes among them (<hi rend="italic">Jimmy Legs</hi>) implying under the form of merriment their cherished disrespect and dislike. <pb facs="https://iiif.archivengine.com/iiif/3/jnd00la229zo9ddsd7gj568ygbip;1" corresp="img_356" /> But in view of the greediness of hate for pabulum it hardly needed a purveyor to feed Claggart's passion.

But he deleted "some natures like" and the "'s" in "Claggart's," then inserted "the" to read "underlying the Claggart." HS and NN restore "some natures like Claggart's." MEL deletes "the" so that the passage reads "underlying Claggart." But now "they" in the next sentence is ambiguous, "some natures" having been deleted. MEL recognizes the ambiguity but retains Melville's wording, which establishes an analogy between "Guy Fawks" and "Claggart."</note> can really form no conception of an unreciprocated malice. <pb facs="https://iiif.archivengine.com/iiif/3/unu2n9nasro2kedmydc2f5ah5dmy;1" corresp="img_362" /> Probably, the master-at-arms' clandestine persecution of Billy <ref target="#ref_29933">were</ref><note xml:id="ref_29933">REVISION NARRATIVE: were // The sentence's singular subject "persecution" would, in the indicative, take the singular verb "was," and HS and NN emend "were" to "was."

The false start "insuf," probably for "insuficiently," appears before "inadequately." (HS and NN transcribe the false start as "xxxx".)
