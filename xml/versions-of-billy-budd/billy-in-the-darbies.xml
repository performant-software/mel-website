	<l>Good of the Chaplain to enter Lone Bay</l>
<l>And down on his marrow-bones here and pray</l>
<l>For the likes just o' me, Billy Budd.—But, look:</l>
<l>Through the port comes the moon-shine astray!</l>
<l>It tips the guard's <choice ><orig>cutlas</orig><reg>cutlass</reg></choice> and silvers this nook;</l>
<l>But 'twill die in the dawning of Billy's last day. </l>
<l>A jewel-block they'll make of me tomorrow,</l>
<l>Pendant pearl from the yard-arm-end</l>
<l>Like the ear-drop I gave to Bristol Molly— <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0791.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/17622"/></l>
<l>O, 'tis me, not the sentence they'll suspend. </l>
<l>Ay, Ay, all is up; and I must up too</l>
<l>Early in the morning, aloft from alow.</l>
<l>On an empty stomach now never it would do.  </l>
<l>They'll give me a nibble—bit o' <choice ><orig>buiscit</orig><reg>biscuit</reg></choice> ere I go.</l>
<l>Sure, a messmate will reach me the last parting cup;</l>
<l>But, turning heads away from the hoist and the belay,</l>
<l>Heaven knows who will have the running of me up!</l>
<l>No pipe to those halyards.—But aren't it all sham?</l>
<l>A blur's in my eyes; it is dreaming that I am. </l>
<l>A hatchet to my <choice ><orig>hauzer</orig><reg>hawser</reg></choice>? all adrift to go? <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0793.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/17621"/></l>
<l>The drum roll to grog, and Billy never know?</l>
<l>But Donald he has promised to stand by the plank;</l>
<l>So I'll shake a friendly hand ere I sink.</l>
<l>But—no! It is dead then I'll be, come to think.—</l>
<l>I remember Taff the Welshman when he sank.</l>
<l>And his cheek it was like the budding pink</l>
<l>But me they'll lash me in hammock, drop me deep. <pb facs="https://iip.textlab.org/?IIIF=mel/billybudd/modbm_ms_am_188_363_0795.tif" tl_leaf="https://app.textlab.org/transcriptions/17620"/></l>
