                    from <tei-hi rend="italic" data-origname="hi">Greene's Groats-worth of Witte</tei-hi>, slightly misquoted
                    here, was marked on p. xv of volume I of Meville's <tei-hi rend="italic" data-origname="hi">Dramatic
                    Works of William Shakespeare</tei-hi>: "for there is an upstart crow, beautified
                    with our feathers, that, with his tiger's heart wrapped in a player's hide,
                    supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you...".
                    The NN edition claimed that the <tei-hi rend="italic" data-origname="hi">Literary World</tei-hi> retained
                    both "errors" in its printing, but in fact "Groats-worth" was entered in the
                    Stationers' Register 'upon the peril of Henry Chettle' on 20 September 1592, two
                    and a half weeks after Greene's death on 3 September. On the page that Melville
                    marked, Chettle is also mentioned as the publisher. As Chettle arranged for the
                    book to be published, some have claimed that he authored the book, so Melville's
                    claim is not quite an error. MEL therefore retains his original wording.</tei-note>For,
