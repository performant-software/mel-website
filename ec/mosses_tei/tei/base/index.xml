                <head>Hawthorne &amp; His Mosses,</head>
                <head>By a Virginian Spending July in Vermont</head>
                <p>A papered chamber in a fine<lb/> old farm-house -- a mile from any other
                    dwelling,<lb/> and dipped to the eaves in foliage -- surrounded by<lb/>
                    mountains, old woods, and Indian ponds, -- this, surely, is<lb/> the place to
                    write of Hawthorne. Some charm is in<lb/> this northern air, for love and duty
                    seem both impelling<lb/> to the task. A man of a deep &amp; noble nature has
                    seized<lb/> me in this seclusion. His wild, witch voice rings thro' me;<lb/>
                    or, in softer cadences, I seem to hear it in the songs of<lb/> the hill-side
                    birds, that sing in the larch trees at my<lb/> window.</p>
                <p>Would that all excellent books were foundlings,<lb/> without father or mother,
                    that so it might be, we<lb/> could glorify them, without including their
                    ostensible authors. Nor<lb/> would any true man take exception to this; --
                    least of all,<lb/> he who writes, -- "When the Artist rises high enough to<lb/>
                    achieve the Beautiful, the symbol by which he makes it<lb/> perceptible to
                    mortal senses becomes of little value in his<lb/> eyes, while his spirit
                    possesses itself in the enjoyment<lb/> of the reality."</p>
                <p>But more than this. I know not</p>
            </div>

            <div type="leaf" n="2">

                <p>what would be the right name to put on the<lb/> title-page of an excellent book,
                    but this I feel, that <lb/>the names of all fine authors are fictitious ones,
                    far <lb/>more so than that of Junius-- simply standing, as they do, for the <lb/>
                    mystical, ever-eluding Spirit of all Beauty, which <lb/> ubiquitously possesses
                    men of genius. Purely <reg>imaginative</reg>
               <orig>imagina<lb/> tive</orig> as
                    this fancy may appear, it nevertheless seems to <lb/> receive some warrantry
                    from the fact, that on a personal <lb/> interview no great author has ever come
                    up to the <lb/> idea of his reader. But that dust of which our <lb/> bodies
                    are composed, how can it fitly express <lb/> the nobler intelligences among us?
                    With reverence be <lb/> it spoken, that not even in the case of one deemed <lb/>
                    more than man, not even in our Saviour, did his <lb/> visible frame betoken
                    anything of the augustness of the nature within. <lb/> Else, how could those
                    Jewish eyewitnesses fail to <lb/> see heaven in his glance.</p>
                <p> It is curious, how a man may travel <lb/> along a country road, and yet miss
                    the grandest, <lb/> or sweetest of prospects, by reason of an intervening <lb/>
                    hedge, so like all other hedges, as in no way <lb/> to hint of the wide
                    landscape beyond.<lb/> So has it been with me concerning the enchanting <lb/>
                    landscape in the soul of this Hawthorne, this most <lb/> excellent Man of
                    Mosses. His "Old Manse" has been <lb/> written now four years, but I never read
                    it till a day or two since.<lb/>. I had seen it in the book-stores -- <lb/>
                    heard of it often -- even had it recommended to me <lb/> by a tasteful friend,
                    as a rare, quiet book, perhaps <lb/> too deserving of popularity to be popular.
                    But there are <lb/> so many books called "excellent," and so much</p>
            </div>

            <div type="leaf" n="3">
                <pb facs="#f002"/>
                <p>unpopular merit, that amid the thick stir of <lb/> other things, the hint of my
                    tasteful friend was <lb/> disregarded; and for four years the Mosses on <lb/>
                    the old Manse never refreshed me with their <lb/> perennial green. It may be,
                    however, that all this <lb/> while, the book, like wine, was only improving in <lb/>
                    flavor and body. At any rate, it so chanced <lb/> that this long
                    procrastination eventuated in a happy <lb/> result. At breakfast the other day,
                    a mountain <lb/> girl, a cousin of mine, who for the last two weeks <lb/> has
                    every morning helped me to strawberries and <lb/> raspberries,-- which, likethe
                    roses and pearls in the fairy tale, <lb/> seemed to fall into the saucer from
                    those strawberry- <lb/> beds her cheeks,-- this delightful creature, this
                    charming <lb/> Cherry says to me -- "I see you spend your mornings <lb/> in
                    the hay-mow; and yesterday I found there '"Dwight's <lb/> Travels in New
                    England'". Now I have something far <lb/> better than that,--something more
                    congenial to our <lb/> summer on these hills. Take these raspberries, and <lb/>
                    then I will give you some moss." -- "Moss"! said I. -- "Yes, <lb/> and you must
                    take it to the barn with you, and <lb/> good-bye to 'Dwight' ". [With that she
                    left me,<lb/> and soon returned with a volume, verdantly <lb/> bound, and
                    garnished with a curious frontispiece in <lb/> green,-- nothing less, than a
                    fragment of real moss <lb/> cunningly pressed to a fly-leaf. -- "Why this,"
                    said I <lb/> spilling my raspberries, "this is the 'Mosses from an <lb/> Old
                    Manse'." "Yes" said cousin Cherry "yes, it is that flowery <lb/> Hawthorne." --</p>
                <p>-- "Hawthorne and Mosses" said I "no more: <lb/> it is morning: it is July in
                    the country: and I</p>

                    promise to his guests in the Old Manse, of whom <lb/> it is written -- "Others
                    could give them pleasure, <lb/> "<hi rend="bold">or</hi> amusement, or
                    instruction -- these could be <lb/> "picked up anywhere -- but it was for me to <lb/>

                    in the <lb/> new clover , I watched this Hawthorne's <lb/> "Assyrian dawn, and
                    Paphian sunset and moon-<lb/> rise, from the summit of our Eastern Hill."</p>
                <p>The soft ravishments of the man spun me round <lb/> about in a web of dreams,
                    and when the book was <lb/> closed, when the spell was over, this wizard <lb/>
                    "dismissed me with but misty reminiscences, as if <lb/> I had been dreaming of
                    him"</p>
                <p>What a mild moonlight of contemplative <lb/>humor bathes that Old Manse!-- the
                    rich and <lb/> rare distilment of a spicy and slowly-oozing heart.<lb/> No
                    rollicking <hi rend="bold">rudeness,</hi> no gross fun fed on fat dinners, <lb/>
                    and bred in the lees of wine,-- but a humor <lb/> so spiritually gentle, so

                <p> Some may start to read of Shakespeare and <lb/>Hawthorne on the same page. They
