                    Hawthorne &amp; His Mosses,</head>
                <head>By a Virginian Spending July in Vermont</head>
                <p>A papered chamber in a fine<lb/> old farm-house -- a mile from any other
                    dwelling,<lb/> and dipped to the eaves in foliage -- surrounded by<lb/>
                    mountains, old woods, and Indian ponds, -- this, surely, is<lb/> the place to
                    write of Hawthorne. Some charm is in<lb/> this northern air, for love and duty
                    seem both impelling<lb/> to the task. A man of a deep &amp; noble nature has
                    seized<lb/> me in this seclusion. His wild, witch voice rings thro' me;<lb/>
                    or, in softer cadences, I seem to hear it in the songs of<lb/> the hill-side
                    birds, that sing in the larch trees at my<lb/> window.</p>
                <p>Would that all excellent books were foundlings,<lb/> without father or mother,
                    that so it might be, we<lb/> could glorify them, without including their <metamark>

                    exception to this; -- least of all,<lb/> he who writes, -- "When the Artist
                    rises high enough to<lb/> achieve the Beautiful, the symbol by which he makes
                    it<lb/> perceptible to mortal senses becomes of little value in his<lb/> eyes,
                    while his spirit possesses itself in the enjoyment<lb/> of the reality."</p>
                <p>But more than this. I know not</p>

                The upper segment (10.4 by 19.5 cm), as just stated, is Duyckinck’s editorial patch
                that replaced Melville’s revision patch (now Leaf 14). It was irregularly scissored
                and torn from a different paper stock and fastened to the lower segment by dabs of
                sealing wax. (Later reinforcement tape has been placed along its top edge, verso.)
                The lower segment (28.2 by 19 cm) is of the same paper stock as most of the others;
                as just stated, it was EM Leaf 14, the top of which Melville replaced. At its top
                Duyckinck added in ink his page number “14½” and his doubly underlined heading
