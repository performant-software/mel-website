                <p> praise <lb/>mediocrity even, in her own children, before <lb/>she praises (for
                    everywhere, merit demands <lb/>acknowledgment from every one) the best<lb/>
                    excellence in the children of any other land. <lb/>Let her own authors, I say,
                    have the pri-<lb/>ority of appreciation. I was much pleased <lb/>with a
                    hot-headed Carolina cousin of mine,<lb/> who once said,--"If there were no
                    other<lb/> American to stand by, in literature, why, then, <lb/>I would stand
                    by Pop Emmons and his "Fre-<lb/>doniad," and till a better epic came along, <lb/>swear
                    it was not very far behind the Iliad." <lb/>Take away the words, and in spirit
                    he was <lb/>sound.</p>
