                <head>HAWTHORNE AND HIS MOSSES.</head>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">A papered</hi> chamber in a fine old farm-house,<lb/> a
                    mile from any other dwelling, and dipped to <lb/> the eaves in
                    foliage--surrounded by moun-<lb/>tains, old woods, and Indian ponds,--this,
                    surely, is the place to write of Hawthorne.<lb/> Some charm is in this northern
                    air, for love<lb/> and duty seem both impelling to the task. A<lb/> man of a
                    deep and noble nature has seized me<lb/> in this seclusion. His wild,
                    witch-voice rings <lb/> through me; or, in softer cadences, I seem to hear it
                    in the songs of the hill-side birds <lb/> that sing in the larch trees at my
                    window.</p>
                <p>Would that all excellent books were found-<lb/>lings, without father or mother,
                    that so it<lb/> might be we could glorify them, without in-<lb/>cluding their
                    ostensible authors!<note>HM had used a full-stop in the MS.</note> Nor would<lb/>
                    any true man take exception to this; least of<lb/> all, he who writes, "When
                    the Artist rises high<lb/> enough to achieve the Beautiful, the symbol by<lb/>
                    which he makes it perceptible to mortal senses<lb/> becomes of little value in
                    his eyes, while his<lb/> spirit possesses itself in the enjoyment of the
                    reality."</p>
                <p>But more than this. I know not</p>
