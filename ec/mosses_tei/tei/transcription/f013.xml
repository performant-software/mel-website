                The upper segment (10.4 by 19.5 cm), as just stated, is Duyckinck’s editorial patch
                that replaced Melville’s revision patch (now Leaf 14). It was irregularly scissored
                and torn from a different paper stock and fastened to the lower segment by dabs of
                sealing wax. (Later reinforcement tape has been placed along its top edge, verso.)
                The lower segment (28.2 by 19 cm) is of the same paper stock as most of the others;
                as just stated, it was EM Leaf 14, the top of which Melville replaced. At its top
                Duyckinck added in ink his page number “14½” and his doubly underlined heading
                “Hawthorne and His Mosses / By a Virginian Spending July in Vermont / (Concluded
                from the last number.)”.” (NN PT, 658)-->
